Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Biology 9700 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. Why choose this syllabus?

# Key concepts

Key concepts are essential ideas that help students develop a deep understanding of their subject and make links between different aspects. Key concepts may open up new ways of thinking about, understanding or interpreting the important things to be learned.

Good teaching and learning will incorporate and reinforce a subject’s key concepts to help students gain:

- a greater depth as well as breadth of subject knowledge
- confidence, especially in applying knowledge and skills in new situations
- the vocabulary to discuss their subject conceptually and show how different aspects link together
- a level of mastery of their subject to help them enter higher education.

The key concepts identified below, carefully introduced and developed, will help to underpin the course you will teach. You may identify additional key concepts which will also enrich teaching and learning.

# The key concepts for Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Biology are:

- Cells as the units of life
A cell is the basic unit of life and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. There are two fundamental types of cell: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Understanding how cells work provides an insight into the fundamental processes of all living organisms.
- Biochemical processes
Cells are dynamic structures within which the chemistry of life takes place. Biochemistry and molecular biology help to explain how and why cells function as they do.
- DNA, the molecule of heredity
Cells contain the molecule of heredity, DNA. DNA is essential for the continuity and evolution of life by allowing genetic information to be stored accurately, to be copied to daughter cells, to be passed from one generation to the next and for the controlled production of proteins. Rare errors in the accurate copying of DNA known as mutations result in genetic variation and are essential for evolution.
- Natural selection
Natural selection acts on genetic variation and is the major mechanism in evolution, including speciation. Natural selection results in the accumulation of beneficial genetic mutations within populations and explains how populations can adapt to meet the demands of changing environments.
- Organisms in their environment
All organisms interact with their biotic and abiotic environment. Studying these interactions allows biologists to understand better the effect of human activities on ecosystems, to develop more effective strategies to conserve biodiversity and to predict more accurately the future implications for humans of changes in the natural world.
- Observation and experiment
The different fields of biology are intertwined and cannot be studied in isolation. Observation, enquiry, experimentation and fieldwork are fundamental to biology, allowing relevant evidence to be collected and considered as a basis on which to build new models and theories. Such models and theories are further tested by experimentation and observation in a cyclical process of feedback and refinement, allowing the development of robust and evidence-based conceptual understandings.

Our expertise in curriculum, teaching and learning, and assessment is the basis for the recognition of our programmes and qualifications around the world. Every year thousands of students with Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Levels gain places at leading universities worldwide. Our programmes and qualifications are valued by top universities around the world including those in the UK, US (including Ivy League universities), Europe, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

UK NARIC*, the national agency in the UK for the recognition and comparison of international qualifications and skills, has carried out an independent benchmarking study of Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level and found it to be comparable to the standard of AS &#x26; A Level in the UK. This means students can be confident that their Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level qualifications are accepted as equivalent, grade for grade, to UK AS &#x26; A Levels by leading universities worldwide.

Cambridge International AS Level Biology makes up the first half of the Cambridge International A Level course in biology and provides a foundation for the study of biology at Cambridge International A Level. Depending on local university entrance requirements, students may be able to use it to progress directly to university courses in biology or some other subjects. It is also suitable as part of a course of general education.

Cambridge International A Level Biology provides a foundation for the study of biology or related courses in higher education. Equally it is suitable as part of a course of general education.

For more information about the relationship between the Cambridge International AS Level and Cambridge International A Level see the ‘Assessment overview’ section of the Syllabus overview.

We recommend learners check the Cambridge recognition database and university websites to find the most up-to-date entry requirements for courses they wish to study.

* Due to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the UK NARIC national recognition agency function was re-titled as UK ENIC on 1 March 2021, operated and managed by Ecctis Limited. From 1 March 2021, international benchmarking findings are published under the Ecctis name.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Biology 9700 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027

# 3 Subject content

Candidates for Cambridge International AS Level should study topics 1–11. Candidates for Cambridge International A Level should study all topics. The content of the AS Level learning outcomes are assumed knowledge for the A Level components.

Teachers should refer to the social, environmental, economic and technological aspects of biology wherever possible throughout the syllabus. Some examples are included in the syllabus and teachers should encourage learners to apply the principles of these examples to other situations introduced in the course.

Teachers should illustrate concepts and content with examples taken from a wide range of organisms. Everything we know about biology has been learned through practical investigation. Learners also find practical work motivating and interesting, and it can help them to understand abstract theoretical concepts. Cambridge International expects that practical activities will underpin the teaching of the whole syllabus.

The syllabus content for practical skills is in the Practical assessment section. Teachers should ensure that candidates are prepared for the assessment of theory learning outcomes and practical skills.

This syllabus gives you the flexibility to design a course that will interest, challenge and engage your learners. Where appropriate you are responsible for selecting suitable subject contexts, resources and examples to support your learners’ study. These should be appropriate for the learners’ age, cultural background and learning context as well as complying with your school policies and local legal requirements.

Support for teaching practical skills for these qualifications can be found on the School Support Hub www.cambridgeinternational.org/support

# AS Level subject content

# 1  Cell structure

All organisms are composed of cells. Knowledge of the structure and function of cells underpins much of biology. The fundamental differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells are explored and provide useful biological background for the topic on Infectious diseases (Topic 10). Viruses are introduced as non-cellular structures, which gives candidates the opportunity to consider whether cells are the basic unit of life. The use of light microscopes is a fundamental skill that is developed in this topic and applied throughout several other topics of the syllabus.

# 1.1 The microscope in cell studies

# Learning outcomes

Candidates should be able to:

1. make temporary preparations of cellular material suitable for viewing with a light microscope
2. draw cells from microscope slides and photomicrographs
3. calculate magnifications of images and actual sizes of specimens from drawings, photomicrographs and electron micrographs (scanning and transmission)
4. use an eyepiece graticule and stage micrometer scale to make measurements and use the appropriate units, millimetre (mm), micrometre (μm) and nanometre (nm)
5. define resolution and magnification and explain the differences between these terms, with reference to light microscopy and electron microscopy

# 1.2 Cells as the basic units of living organisms

# Learning outcomes

All of these molecules are based on the versatile element carbon. This topic explains how carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, which have a great diversity of function in organisms, are assembled from smaller organic molecules such as glucose, amino acids, glycerol and fatty acids.

The emphasis in this topic is on the relationship between molecular structures and their functions. Some of these ideas are continued in other topics, for example, the functions of haemoglobin in gas transport in Transport in mammals (Topic 8), phospholipids in membranes in Cell membranes and transport (Topic 4) and antibodies in Immunity (Topic 11).

Life as we know it would not be possible without water. Understanding the properties of this extraordinary molecule is an essential part of any study of biological molecules. Some of the roles of water are in this topic, others are in Topics 4, 7, 8, 12, 13 and 14.

# 4  Cell membranes and transport

The fluid mosaic model, introduced in 1972, describes the way in which biological molecules are arranged to form cell membranes. The model continues to be modified as understanding improves of the ways in which substances cross membranes, how cells interact and how cells respond to signals. The model also provides the basis for our understanding of passive and active movement of molecules and ions between cells and their surroundings, cell-to-cell interactions and long-distance cell signalling.

Nucleic acids have roles in the storage and retrieval of genetic information and in the use of this information to synthesise polypeptides. DNA is the molecule of heredity and is an extremely stable molecule that cells replicate with great accuracy.

# 14 Homeostasis

Cells function most efficiently if they are kept in near optimum conditions. Cells in multicellular animals are surrounded by tissue fluid. The composition of tissue fluid is kept constant by exchanges with the blood as discussed in the topic on Transport in mammals (Topic 8). In mammals, core temperature, blood glucose concentration and blood water potential are maintained within narrow limits to ensure the efficient operation of cells. Prior knowledge for this topic includes an understanding that waste products are excreted from the body and an outline of the structure and function of the nervous and endocrine systems. In plants, guard cells respond to fluctuations in environmental conditions and open and close stomata as appropriate for photosynthesis and conserving water.

# 16 Inheritance

Genetic information is transmitted from generation to generation to maintain the continuity of life. In sexual reproduction, meiosis introduces genetic variation so that offspring resemble their parents but are not identical to them. Genetic crosses reveal how some features are inherited. The phenotype of organisms is determined partly by the genes that they have inherited and partly by the effect of the environment. Genes determine how organisms develop; gene control in bacteria gives us a glimpse of this process in action.

# 17 Selection and evolution

In 1858, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace proposed a theory of natural selection to account for the evolution of species. A year later, Darwin published *On the Origin of Species*, providing evidence for the way in which aspects of the environment act as agents of selection and determine which phenotypic forms survive and which do not. The individuals best adapted to the prevailing conditions are most likely to succeed in the ‘struggle for existence’.

Teachers should ensure that learners practise practical skills throughout their course of study. As a guide, learners should spend at least 20 per cent of their time doing practical work individually or in small groups. This 20 per cent does not include the time spent observing demonstrations of experiments and simulations.

The practical work that learners do during their course should aim to:

- provide learning opportunities so that they develop the skills they need to carry out experimental and investigative work
- reinforce their learning of the theoretical subject content of the syllabus
- instil an understanding of the relationship between experimentation and theory in scientific method
- be enjoyable, contributing to the motivation of learners.

Candidates’ practical skills will be assessed in Paper 3 and Paper 5. In each of these papers, the questions may be based on biology not included in the syllabus content, but candidates will be mainly assessed on their practical skills rather than their knowledge of theory. Where appropriate, candidates will be given any additional information that they need.

# Paper 3 Advanced Practical Skills

Paper 3 is a timetabled, laboratory-based practical paper focusing on the practical skills of:

- manipulation, measurement and observation
- presentation of data and observations
- analysis, conclusions and evaluation.

Centres should refer to the document ‘How to manage your sciences practical exams’ for advice on making entries and organisation of candidates for practical exams.

Paper 3 consists of two or three questions, totalling 40 marks. The paper:

- requires candidates to carry out an investigation or investigations. They may be asked to:
- make decisions on techniques
- collect quantitative or qualitative data
- present the data or observations as tables, charts, graphs and other appropriate means
- analyse the data appropriately, including calculations
- draw conclusions
- suggest improvements to the procedure or modifications for extending the investigation
- requires candidates to carry out activities using a light microscope. They may be asked to:
- prepare slides
- make observations of specimens
- present their observations appropriately
- analyse data appropriately, including calculations
- make deductions and conclusions from the observations

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Biology 9700 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. Details of the assessment

• requires each centre to provide microscopes for half of the candidates at a time (see Apparatus and materials section for microscope specifications), so half the candidates should start on the investigation while the others start with access to the light microscope

• includes questions set in different areas of AS Level Biology, and may include material from unfamiliar contexts. Candidates will be expected to show evidence of skills in the handling of familiar and unfamiliar biological material. Where unfamiliar materials or techniques are required, full instructions will be given.

No dissection of materials of animal origin will be required in Paper 3. However, the use of dissection, interactive videos or similar will continue to be a useful aid to teaching, e.g. when the heart is being studied.

The apparatus requirements for Paper 3 will vary from paper to paper. A complete list of apparatus and materials required will be issued to centres in the confidential instructions. The confidential instructions should be followed very carefully. If there are any queries regarding the confidential instructions, centres should contact Cambridge International as soon as possible.

- conclusions
- evaluation.

This exam will not require laboratory facilities.

To prepare candidates for this exam, it should be emphasised that candidates will need extensive experience of laboratory work of A Level standard. This requires many hours of laboratory-based work, with careful supervision from teachers to ensure that experiments are planned and carried out safely.

Paper 5 may include questions assessing both the AS and A Level syllabus and may include unfamiliar contexts. Where questions include theory or equipment which would be unfamiliar to candidates, information will be provided in the question.

Paper 5 consists of two or more questions totalling 30 marks.

Candidates are required to:

- use extended structured writing
- use appropriate diagrams and tables to illustrate answers
- design an experimental method for a given problem, for which they may be asked to use given information or a specific piece of apparatus
- express a prediction linking independent and dependent variables, either as a written hypothesis or as a graph showing the expected result
- analyse and evaluate given experimental data, presented as tables, graphs or written statements, and draw appropriate conclusions
- identify appropriate mathematical or statistical methods to process experimental data.

# Notes on the use of statistics in Biology (A Level only)

Paper 4 and Paper 5 may include questions involving the use of descriptive statistics and the statistical tests stated in the syllabus. Candidates will not be expected to carry out all the steps in calculations of sample standard deviations, t-tests, Pearson’s linear correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation during an examination, but they may be given partly completed calculations to finish.

Candidates are allowed to use electronic calculators in the examination, as long as they are permitted by the Cambridge International general regulations.

# Chi-squared Test

The chi-squared test is used to test whether the difference between observed and expected frequencies of nominal data is significant. The chi-squared test is commonly used in the context of evaluating the results of breeding experiments and some forms of ecological sampling. Chi-squared tests will only be expected on one row or one column of data.

# t-test

The t-test is used to test for the significance of differences between two samples, each with continuous data, including samples with fewer than 30 values. This test can be used if:

- continuous data have been collected
- the data are from populations that are normally distributed
- standard deviations are approximately the same.

# Pearson’s Linear Correlation

Candidates should be able to use Pearson’s linear correlation to test for a correlation between two sets of normally distributed data. The test can be used if:

- continuous data have been collected
- a scatter diagram indicates the possibility of a linear relationship
- the data are from a population that is normally distributed
- there are at least five paired observations, although ideally the number of paired observations should be ten or more.

# Spearman’s Rank Correlation

Spearman’s rank correlation is used to test for a correlation between two sets of data that are not distributed normally. The test can be used if:

- data points within samples are independent of each other
- ordinal data have been collected or the data that have been collected can be converted to an ordinal scale using ranking
- a scatter diagram indicates the possibility of an increasing or a decreasing relationship
- there are more than five paired observations, although ideally the number of paired observations should be between 10 and 30
- all individuals were selected at random from a population and each individual had an equal chance of being selected.

For both Pearson’s linear correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation, candidates should know that correlations exist between –1 (perfect negative correlation), 0 (no correlation) and +1 (perfect positive correlation).

These statistical methods are dealt with fully in many textbooks and websites on statistics for biology.

# 7 What else you need to know

This section is an overview of other information you need to know about this syllabus. It will help to share the administrative information with your exams officer so they know when you will need their support. Find more information about our administrative processes at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide

# Before you start

# Previous study

We recommend that learners starting this course should have completed a course in Biology or Co-ordinated Science equivalent to Cambridge IGCSE™ or Cambridge O Level.

# Guided learning hours

We design Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level syllabuses to require about 180 guided learning hours for each Cambridge International AS Level and about 360 guided learning hours for a Cambridge International A Level. The number of hours a learner needs to achieve the qualification may vary according to each school and the learners’ previous experience of the subject.

# Availability and timetables

All Cambridge schools are allocated to an administrative zone. Each zone has a specific timetable. You can view the timetable for your administrative zone at www.cambridgeinternational.org/timetables. You can enter candidates in the June and November exam series. If your school is in India, you can also enter your candidates in the March exam series.

# Making entries

Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.

# Exam administration

To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as administrative zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to one administrative zone determined by their location. Each zone has a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An entry option code is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone and the available assessment options.

# Support for exams officers

We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the support they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all other phases of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide.

# Retakes and carrying forward marks

Candidates can retake Cambridge International AS Level and Cambridge International A Level as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at www.cambridgeinternational.org/retakes. Candidates can carry forward the result of their Cambridge International AS Level assessment from one series to complete the Cambridge International A Level in a following series, subject to the rules and time limits described in the Cambridge Handbook.

# Language

This syllabus and the related assessment materials are available in English only.

# Accessibility and equality

# Syllabus and assessment design

Cambridge International works to avoid direct or indirect discrimination. We develop and design syllabuses and assessment materials to maximise inclusivity for candidates of all national, cultural or social backgrounds and candidates with protected characteristics; these protected characteristics include special educational needs and disability, religion and belief, and characteristics related to gender and identity. In addition, the language and layout used are designed to make our materials as accessible as possible. This gives all candidates the fairest possible opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding and helps to minimise the requirement to make reasonable adjustments during the assessment process.

# Access arrangements

Access arrangements (including modified papers) are the principal way in which Cambridge International complies with our duty, as guided by the UK Equality Act (2010), to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for candidates with special educational needs (SEN), disability, illness or injury. Where a candidate would otherwise be at a substantial disadvantage in comparison to a candidate with no SEN, disability, illness or injury, we may be able to agree pre-examination access arrangements. These arrangements help a candidate by minimising accessibility barriers and maximising their opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding in an assessment.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Biology 9700 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. What else you need to know

# Important:

- Requested access arrangements should be based on evidence of the candidate’s barrier to assessment and should also reflect their normal way of working at school; this is in line with the Cambridge Handbook www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
- For Cambridge International to approve an access arrangement, we will need to agree that it constitutes a reasonable adjustment, involves reasonable cost and timeframe and does not affect the security and integrity of the assessment.
- Availability of access arrangements should be checked by centres at the start of the course. Details of our standard access arrangements and modified question papers are available in the Cambridge Handbook www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
- Please contact us at the start of the course to find out if we are able to approve an arrangement that is not included in the list of standard access arrangements.
- Candidates who cannot access parts of the assessment may be able to receive an award based on the parts they have completed.

# After the exam

# Grading and reporting

Grades A*, A, B, C, D or E indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge International A Level. A* is the highest and E is the lowest grade.

Grades a, b, c, d or e indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge International AS Level. ‘a’ is the highest and ‘e’ is the lowest grade.

‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the standard required for the lowest grade (E or e). ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:

- Q (PENDING)
- X (NO RESULT).

These letters do not appear on the certificate.

If a candidate takes a Cambridge International A Level and fails to achieve grade E or higher, a Cambridge International AS Level grade will be awarded if both of the following apply:

- the components taken for the Cambridge International A Level by the candidate in that series included all the components making up a Cambridge International AS Level
- the candidate’s performance on the AS Level components was sufficient to merit the award of a Cambridge International AS Level grade.

On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Levels are shown as General Certificates of Education, GCE Advanced Subsidiary Level (GCE AS Level) and GCE Advanced Level (GCE A Level).

# School feedback:

‘Cambridge International A Levels are the ‘gold standard’ qualification. They are based on rigorous, academic syllabuses that are accessible to students from a wide range of abilities yet have the capacity to stretch our most able.’

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Biology 9700 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. What else you need to know

# How students, teachers and higher education can use the grades

# Cambridge International A Level

Assessment at Cambridge International A Level has two purposes:

1. to measure learning and achievement

The assessment confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
2. to show likely future success

The outcomes help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are more likely to be successful.

The outcomes help students choose the most suitable course or career.

# Cambridge International AS Level

Assessment at Cambridge International AS Level has two purposes:

1. to measure learning and achievement

The assessment confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in the syllabus.
2. to show likely future success

The outcomes help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are more likely to be successful.

The outcomes help students choose the most suitable course or career.

The outcomes help decide whether students part way through a Cambridge International A Level course are making enough progress to continue.

The outcomes guide teaching and learning in the next stages of the Cambridge International A Level course.

# Grade descriptions

Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better performance in some other aspect.

Grade descriptions for Cambridge International A Level Biology will be published after the first assessment of the A Level in 2022.
