Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. Why choose this syllabus?

# Key concepts

Key concepts are essential ideas that help students develop a deep understanding of their subject and make links between different aspects. Key concepts may open up new ways of thinking about, understanding or interpreting the important things to be learned.

Good teaching and learning will incorporate and reinforce a subject’s key concepts to help students gain:

- a greater depth as well as breadth of subject knowledge
- confidence, especially in applying knowledge and skills in new situations
- the vocabulary to discuss their subject conceptually and show how different aspects link together
- a level of mastery of their subject to help them enter higher education.

The key concepts identified below, carefully introduced and developed, will help to underpin the course you will teach. You may identify additional key concepts which will also enrich teaching and learning.

# The key concepts for Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics are:

- Models of physical systems
Physics is the science that seeks to understand the behaviour of the Universe. The development of models of physical systems is central to physics. Models simplify, explain and predict how physical systems behave.
- Testing predictions against evidence
Physical models are usually based on prior observations, and their predictions are tested to check that they are consistent with the behaviour of the real world. This testing requires evidence, often obtained from experiments.
- Mathematics as a language, and problem-solving tool
Mathematics is integral to physics, as it is the language that is used to express physical principles and models. It is also a tool to analyse theoretical models, solve quantitative problems and produce predictions.
- Matter, energy and waves
Everything in the Universe comprises matter and/or energy. Waves are a key mechanism for the transfer of energy and are essential to many modern applications of physics.
- Forces and fields
The way that matter and energy interact is through forces and fields. The behaviour of the Universe is governed by fundamental forces with different magnitudes that interact over different distances. Physics involves study of these interactions across distances ranging from the very small (quantum and particle physics) to the very large (astronomy and cosmology).

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

# 3 Subject content

This syllabus gives you the flexibility to design a course that will interest, challenge and engage your learners. Where appropriate you are responsible for selecting subject contexts, resources and examples to support your learners’ study. These should be appropriate for the learners’ age, cultural background and learning context as well as complying with your school policies and local legal requirements.

Candidates for Cambridge International AS Level should study topics 1–11. Candidates for Cambridge International A Level should study all topics. The content of the AS Level learning outcomes is assumed knowledge for the A Level components.

Teachers should refer to the social, environmental, economic and technological aspects of physics wherever possible throughout the syllabus. Some examples are included in the syllabus and teachers should encourage learners to apply the principles of these examples to other situations introduced in the course.

The syllabus content for practical skills is in the Practical assessment section. Teachers should ensure that candidates are prepared for the assessment of both theory learning outcomes and practical skills.

Support for teaching practical skills for these qualifications can be found on the School Support Hub www.cambridgeinternational.org/support

# Data and formulae

Data and formulae will appear as page 2 in Papers 1 and 2 and pages 2 and 3 in Paper 4. The data and formulae are shown in section 6.

# Decimal markers

In accordance with current ASE convention, decimal markers in examination papers will be a single dot on the line. Candidates are expected to follow this convention in their answers.

# Units

In practical work, candidates will be expected to use SI units or, where appropriate, units approved by the BIPM for use with the SI (e.g. minute). A list of SI units and units approved for use with the SI may be found in the SI brochure at www.bipm.org. The use of imperial/customary units such as the inch and degree Fahrenheit is not acceptable and should be discouraged. In all examinations, where data is supplied for use in questions, candidates will be expected to use units that are consistent with the units supplied, and should not attempt conversion to other systems of units unless this is a requirement of the question.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

# 5 Practical assessment

# Introduction

Teachers should ensure that learners practise experimental skills throughout their course of study. As a guide, learners should spend at least 20 per cent of their time doing practical work individually or in small groups. This 20 per cent does not include the time spent observing demonstrations of experiments.

The practical work that learners do during their course should aim to:

- provide learning opportunities so they develop the skills they need to carry out experimental and investigative work
- reinforce their learning of the theoretical subject content of the syllabus
- instil an understanding of the relationship between experimentation and theory in scientific method
- be enjoyable, contributing to the motivation of learners.

Candidates’ experimental skills will be assessed in Paper 3 and Paper 5. In each of these papers, the questions may be based on physics not included in the syllabus content, but candidates will be assessed on their practical skills rather than their knowledge of theory. Where appropriate, candidates will be given any additional information that they need.

# Paper 3 Advanced Practical Skills

Paper 3 is a timetabled, laboratory-based practical paper focusing on the experimental skills of:

- manipulation, measurement and observation
- presentation of data and observations
- analysis, conclusions and evaluation.

Centres should refer to the document ‘How to manage your sciences practical exams’ for advice on making entries and organisation of candidates for practical exams.

Paper 3 consists of two questions, each of 1 hour and each of 20 marks.

Question 1 will be an experiment requiring candidates to collect data, to plot a graph and to draw conclusions. Question 2 will be an experiment requiring candidates to collect data and to draw conclusions, but may or may not include the plotting of a graph. In the second question, the experimental method to be followed will be inaccurate, and candidates will be required to evaluate the method and suggest improvements.

The two questions will be set in different areas of physics. No prior knowledge of the theory will be required.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. Practical assessment

# Expectations for each skill (Paper 3)

# Manipulation, measurement and observation

# Successful collection of data

Candidates should be able to:

- set up apparatus correctly without assistance from the supervisor
- follow instructions given in the form of written instructions and diagrams (including circuit diagrams)
- use their apparatus to collect an appropriate quantity of data
- repeat readings where appropriate
- make measurements using common laboratory apparatus, such as millimetre scales, protractors, top-pan balances, newton meters, analogue or digital electrical meters, measuring cylinders, calipers*, micrometer screw gauges and thermometers
- use a stop-watch to measure intervals of time, including the period of an oscillating system by timing an appropriate number of consecutive oscillations
- use both analogue scales and digital displays.

* Where calipers are required in the examination, centres may provide either vernier or digital calipers. Candidates should be familiar with the type of calipers provided.

Some candidates will be unable to set up their apparatus without help and may ask for assistance from the supervisor. Supervisors will be given clear instructions on what assistance may be given to candidates, but this assistance should never go beyond the minimum necessary to enable candidates to take some readings: under no circumstances should help be given with the presentation of data, analysis or evaluation sections. All assistance must be reported to the examiners by recording details of the help given on the supervisor’s report, and candidates who require assistance will not be awarded full credit for the successful collection of data.

# Quality of data

Candidates should be able to:

- make and record accurate measurements
- make measurements that span the largest possible range of values within the limits either of the equipment provided or of the instructions given.

Marks will be awarded for measured data in which the values obtained are reasonable. In some cases, the award of the mark will be based on the scatter of points on a graph; in other cases, the candidate’s data may be compared with information supplied by the supervisor or known to the examiners. The examiners will only consider the extent to which the candidate has affected the quality of the data: allowances will be made where the quality of data is limited by the experimental method required or by the apparatus used.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. Practical assessment

# Presentation of data and observations

# Table of results

Candidates should be able to:

- present numerical data and values in a single table of results
- record all data in the table
- draw up the table in advance of taking readings so that they do not have to copy up their results
- include in the table of results columns for raw data and for values calculated from them
- use column headings that include both the quantity and the unit and that conform to accepted scientific conventions.

As an example of accepted scientific convention in column headings, if the quantity being measured is current in milliamperes, then ‘I / mA’ would be the usual way to write the column heading, but ‘I in mA’ or ‘I (mA)’ or ‘current / mA’ would be allowed. Headings such as ‘I mA’ or just ‘mA’ are not acceptable. The quantity or the unit or both may be written in words rather than symbols. Conventional symbols or abbreviations (such as p.d.) may be used without explanation.

# Recording of data, observations and calculations

Candidates should be able to:

- record raw readings of a quantity to the same degree of precision
- calculate other quantities from their raw data
- show their working in calculations, and the key steps in their reasoning
- use and justify the correct number of significant figures in calculated quantities.

For example, if one measurement of length in a column of raw data is given to the nearest millimetre, then all the lengths in that column should be given to the nearest millimetre. The degree of precision used should be compatible with the measuring instrument used: it would be inappropriate to record a distance measured on a millimetre scale as either ‘2cm’ or ‘2.00 cm’.

When a value is calculated from measured quantities (except by addition or subtraction), the appropriate number of significant figures for the calculated value usually depends on the measured quantity with the least number of significant figures. If this quantity has n significant figures, then n or n+1 significant figures are appropriate for the calculated value.

For example, if values of a potential difference and of a current are measured to 2 and 4 significant figures respectively, then the corresponding resistance should be given to 2 or 3 significant figures, but not 1 or 4. The number of significant figures may, if necessary, vary down a column of values for a calculated quantity.

# Graph: Layout

Candidates should be able to:

- clearly label graph axes with both the quantity and the unit, following accepted scientific conventions
- choose scales for graph axes such that the data points occupy at least half of the graph grid in both x- and y-directions
- use a false origin where appropriate
- choose scales for the graph axes that allow the graph to be read easily, such as 1, 2 or 5 units to a 2 cm square
- place regularly-spaced numerical labels along the whole of each axis at least every 2cm.

The accepted scientific conventions for labelling the axes of a graph are the same as for the column headings in a table of results.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. Practical assessment

# Graph: Plotting of points

Candidates should be able to:

- plot all their data points on their graph grid to an accuracy of better than 1 mm.
- Points should be finely drawn with a sharp pencil, but must still be visible. A fine cross or an encircled dot is suitable; plotted points should have a diameter of less than 1 mm.

# Graph: Trend line

Candidates should be able to:

- draw straight lines of best fit or curves to show the trend of a graph
- draw tangents to curved trend lines.

The trend line should show an even distribution of points on either side of the line along its whole length. Lines should be finely drawn, continuous, and with a thickness of less than 1 mm, and should not contain kinks. If necessary, candidates may identify one point as anomalous and ignore this point when drawing the line. The anomalous point must be identified, e.g. circled or labelled.

# Analysis, conclusions and evaluation

# Interpretation of graph

Candidates should be able to:

- relate straight-line graphs to equations of the form y = mx + c, and derive expressions that equate to the gradient and/or the y-intercept of their graphs
- read the coordinates of points on the trend line of a graph
- determine the gradient of a straight-line graph or of a tangent to a curve
- determine the y-intercept of a straight-line graph or of a tangent to a curve, including where these are on graphs with a false origin.

When a gradient is to be determined, the points on the line chosen for the calculation should be separated by more than half of the length of the line drawn. In cases where the y-intercept cannot be read directly from the y-axis, it is expected that the coordinates of a point on the line and the gradient will be substituted into y = mx + c to determine the y-intercept.

# Estimating uncertainties

Candidates should be able to:

- estimate the absolute uncertainty in measurements
- express the uncertainty in a measurement as an absolute or percentage uncertainty, and translate between these forms
- express the absolute uncertainty in a repeated measurement as half the range of the repeated readings, where this is appropriate.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. Practical assessment

# Drawing conclusions

Candidates should be able to:

- draw conclusions from an experiment, including determining the values of constants
- explain whether experimental data supports a given hypothesis
- make predictions.

To determine whether a relationship containing a constant is supported by experimental data, candidates should:

- calculate the percentage difference between values of the constant
- compare this percentage difference with a given percentage uncertainty
- give a conclusion based on this comparison.

# Identifying limitations

Candidates should be able to:

- identify and describe the limitations in an experimental procedure
- identify the most significant sources of uncertainty in an experiment.

For uncertainties in measured quantities, candidates should state the quantity being measured and a reason for the uncertainty.

# Suggesting improvements

Candidates should be able to:

- suggest modifications to an experimental arrangement that will improve the accuracy of the experiment or to extend the investigation to answer a new question
- describe these modifications clearly in words or diagrams.

Candidates’ suggestions should be realistic, so that in principle they are achievable in practice in a school laboratory. The suggestions may include the use of other apparatus or different procedures, but not a different experiment. The suggested modifications may relate to sources of uncertainty identified by the candidate. Improvements that could have been made with the apparatus provided while following the instructions in the question will not normally gain credit.

# Administration of Paper 3

Detailed regulations on the administration of Cambridge International practical examinations are contained in the Cambridge Handbook.

Details of the specific requirements for apparatus and materials for a particular examination are given in the confidential instructions which are sent to centres several weeks prior to the examination. Centres should contact Cambridge International if they believe the confidential instructions have not been received.

It is the responsibility of centres to provide the apparatus for practical examinations. Cambridge is not able to supply apparatus directly or provide advice on local suppliers of apparatus.

# Paper 5 Planning, Analysis and Evaluation

Paper 5 will be a timetabled written paper, focusing on the higher-order experimental skills of planning, analysis and evaluation.

This examination will not require laboratory facilities.

To prepare candidates for this exam, it should be emphasised that candidates will need extensive experience of laboratory work of A Level standard. In particular, learners cannot be taught to plan experiments effectively unless, on a number of occasions, they are required to:

- plan an experiment
- perform the experiment according to their plan
- evaluate what they have done.

This requires many hours of laboratory-based work and careful supervision from teachers to ensure that experiments are performed safely.

Paper 5 will consist of two questions each of 15 marks.

Question 1 will be a planning question, in which candidates will be required to design an experimental investigation of a given problem. The question will not be highly structured: candidates will be expected to answer with a diagram and an extended piece of writing.

Question 2 will be an analysis, conclusions and evaluation question, in which candidates will be given an equation and some experimental data. From these they will be required to find the value of a constant. This question will be structured but candidates will be expected to decide for themselves what they need to do in order to reach an answer. They will also be required to estimate the uncertainty in their answer.

Some questions on this paper may be set in areas of physics that are difficult to investigate experimentally in school laboratories, either because of the cost of equipment or because of restrictions on the availability of materials (e.g. radioactive materials). No question will require knowledge of theory or equipment that is beyond the syllabus. Candidates will be given the necessary information for questions set on topics that do not form part of the syllabus.

Candidates should be able to:

- complete a table of results following the conventions required for Paper 3
- calculate other quantities from raw data and record them in a table
- use the correct number of significant figures for calculated quantities following the conventions required for Paper 3.

Where logarithms are required, units should be shown with the quantity whose logarithm is being taken, e.g. ln (d/ cm). The logarithm itself does not have a unit.

For logarithmic quantities, the number of decimal places should correspond to the number of significant figures. For example, if L / cm is 76.5 (3 sf), then lg (L / cm) should be either 1.884 (3 dp) or 1.8837 (4 dp).

# Graph

Candidates should be able to:

- plot a graph following the conventions required for Paper 3
- show error bars, in both directions where appropriate, for each point on the graph
- draw a straight line of best fit and a worst acceptable straight line through the points on the graph.

The worst acceptable line should be either the steepest possible line or the shallowest possible line that passes through the error bars of all the data points. It should be distinguished from the line of best fit either by being drawn as a broken line or by being clearly labelled.

# Conclusion

Candidates should be able to:

- determine the gradient and y-intercept of a straight-line graph
- derive expressions that equate to the gradient or the y-intercept of their straight lines of best fit
- draw the required conclusions, with correct units and appropriate number of significant figures, from these expressions.

# Treatment of uncertainties

Candidates should be able to:

- convert absolute uncertainty estimates into fractional or percentage uncertainty estimates and vice versa
- show uncertainty estimates, in absolute terms, beside every value in a table of results
- calculate uncertainty estimates in derived quantities
- estimate the absolute uncertainty in the gradient of a graph by recalling that absolute uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line
- estimate the absolute uncertainty in the y-intercept of a graph by recalling that absolute uncertainty = y-intercept of line of best fit – y-intercept of worst acceptable line
- express a quantity as a value, an uncertainty estimate and a unit.

# 7 What else you need to know

This section is an overview of other information you need to know about this syllabus. It will help to share the administrative information with your exams officer so they know when you will need their support. Find more information about our administrative processes at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide.

# Before you start

# Previous study

We recommend that learners starting this course should have completed a course in Physics or Co-ordinated Science equivalent to Cambridge IGCSE™ or Cambridge O Level.

# Guided learning hours

We design Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level syllabuses to require about 180 guided learning hours for each Cambridge International AS Level and about 360 guided learning hours for a Cambridge International A Level. The number of hours a learner needs to achieve the qualification may vary according to each school and the learners’ previous experience of the subject.

# Availability and timetables

All Cambridge schools are allocated to an administrative zone. Each zone has a specific timetable. You can view the timetable for your administrative zone at www.cambridgeinternational.org/timetables. You can enter candidates in the June and November exam series. If your school is in India, you can also enter your candidates in the March exam series.

Check you are using the syllabus for the year the candidate is taking the exam.

Private candidates can enter for this syllabus. However, it is expected that private candidates learn in an environment where practical work is an integral part of the course. Candidates will not be able to perform well in this assessment or progress successfully to further study without this necessary and important aspect of science education. For more information, please refer to the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries.

# Combining with other syllabuses

Candidates can take this syllabus alongside other Cambridge International syllabuses in a single exam series. The only exceptions are:

- syllabuses with the same title at the same level.

# Group awards: Cambridge AICE

Cambridge AICE (Advanced International Certificate of Education) is a group award for Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level. It allows schools to offer a broad and balanced curriculum by recognising the achievements of learners who pass exams in a range of different subjects.

Learn more about Cambridge AICE at www.cambridgeinternational.org/aice.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. What else you need to know

# Making entries

Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.

# Exam administration

To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as administrative zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to one administrative zone determined by their location. Each zone has a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An entry option code is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone and the available assessment options.

# Support for exams officers

We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the support they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all other phases of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide

# Retakes and carrying forward marks

Candidates can retake Cambridge International AS Level and Cambridge International A Level as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at www.cambridgeinternational.org/retakes. Candidates can carry forward the result of their Cambridge International AS Level assessment from one series to complete the Cambridge International A Level in a following series, subject to the rules and time limits described in the Cambridge Handbook.

# Language

This syllabus and the related assessment materials are available in English only.

# Accessibility and equality

# Syllabus and assessment design

Cambridge International works to avoid direct or indirect discrimination. We develop and design syllabuses and assessment materials to maximise inclusivity for candidates of all national, cultural or social backgrounds and candidates with protected characteristics; these protected characteristics include special educational needs and disability, religion and belief, and characteristics related to gender and identity. In addition, the language and layout used are designed to make our materials as accessible as possible. This gives all candidates the fairest possible opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding and helps to minimise the requirement to make reasonable adjustments during the assessment process.

# Access arrangements

Access arrangements (including modified papers) are the principal way in which Cambridge International complies with our duty, as guided by the UK Equality Act (2010), to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for candidates with special educational needs (SEN), disability, illness or injury. Where a candidate would otherwise be at a substantial disadvantage in comparison to a candidate with no SEN, disability, illness or injury, we may be able to agree pre-examination access arrangements. These arrangements help a candidate by minimising accessibility barriers and maximising their opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding in an assessment.

Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Level Physics 9702 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027. What else you need to know

Important:

- Requested access arrangements should be based on evidence of the candidate’s barrier to assessment and should also reflect their normal way of working at school; this is in line with the Cambridge Handbook www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
- For Cambridge International to approve an access arrangement, we will need to agree that it constitutes a reasonable adjustment, involves reasonable cost and timeframe and does not affect the security and integrity of the assessment.
- Availability of access arrangements should be checked by centres at the start of the course. Details of our standard access arrangements and modified question papers are available in the Cambridge Handbook www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide
- Please contact us at the start of the course to find out if we are able to approve an arrangement that is not included in the list of standard access arrangements.
- Candidates who cannot access parts of the assessment may be able to receive an award based on the parts they have completed.

# Grading and reporting

Grades A*, A, B, C, D or E indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge International A Level. A* is the highest and E is the lowest grade.

Grades a, b, c, d or e indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge International AS Level. ‘a’ is the highest and ‘e’ is the lowest grade.

‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the standard required for the lowest grade (E or e). ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:

- Q (PENDING)
- X (NO RESULT).

These letters do not appear on the certificate.

If a candidate takes a Cambridge International A Level and fails to achieve grade E or higher, a Cambridge International AS Level grade will be awarded if both of the following apply:

- the components taken for the Cambridge International A Level by the candidate in that series included all the components making up a Cambridge International AS Level
- the candidate’s performance on the AS Level components was sufficient to merit the award of a Cambridge International AS Level grade.

On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge International AS &#x26; A Levels are shown as General Certificates of Education, GCE Advanced Subsidiary Level (GCE AS Level) and GCE Advanced Level (GCE A Level).

School feedback: ‘Cambridge International A Levels are the ‘gold standard’ qualification. They are based on rigorous, academic syllabuses that are accessible to students from a wide range of abilities yet have the capacity to stretch our most able.’

Feedback from: Director of Studies, Auckland Grammar School, New Zealand

Assessment at Cambridge International A Level has two purposes:

1. to measure learning and achievement

The assessment confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.
2. to show likely future success

The outcomes help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are more likely to be successful.

The outcomes help students choose the most suitable course or career.

# Cambridge International AS Level

Assessment at Cambridge International AS Level has two purposes:
