Arrangements, accommodations and modifications must be visible in both continuous and summative assessments to enable candidates with special needs to access assessments and receive accurate performance measurement of their abilities. Access arrangements must neither give these candidates an undue advantage over others nor compromise the standards being assessed. Candidates who are unable to access the assessments of any component or part of component due to disability (transitory or permanent) may be eligible to receive an award based on the assessment they would have taken. NB For further details on arrangements, accommodations and modifications refer to the ZIMSEC Assessment Procedure Booklet.\n\n# a) Continuous Assessment\n\nContinuous assessment for Forms 5 and 6 will consist of practical tests, written theory tests and a project.\n\n# Practical tests\n\nThese are practical tests that teachers give to learners individually once a term. The tests should cover manipulation of apparatus, following procedures, result collection, presentation, analysis and evaluation. A practical test consists of 100% skill C.\n\n# i) Written Tests\n\nThese are tests set by the teacher to assess the concepts covered during a term. The tests consist of multiple choice, structured and free response questions. Each test consists of 50% skill A and 50% skill B.\n\n# ii) End of course Project\n\nLearners should have a project that will be assessed at the end of the course. The project can be set at school/district/provincial level but innovative learners should be allowed to come up with their own projects. The project consists of 70% skill C and 30 % skills A and B.\n\n# Summary of Continuous Assessment Tasks\n\nIn Terms 1 to 5, candidates are expected to have done at least the following recorded tasks:\n\n- 5 practical tests\n- 5 written theory tests\n- 1 project\n\n# Detailed Continuous Assessment Tasks Table\n\n---\n\n\n# SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT\n\n| Term | Practical tests      | Written Tests | Project | Total |\n| ---- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ----- |\n| 1    | 1                    |               |         | 1     |\n| 2    | 1                    |               |         | 1     |\n| 3    | 1                    |               |         | 1     |\n| 4    | 1                    |               |         | 1     |\n| 5    | 1                    |               | 1       | 1     |\n| 6    | National Examination |               |         |       |\n\n| Weighting | 10% | 10% | 10% | 30% |\n| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n# Assessment Objectives\n\nThese describe the knowledge, skills and abilities which candidates are expected to demonstrate at the end of the course. They reflect those aspects of the aims which will be assessed.\n\n# Skill A: Knowledge with understanding\n\nCandidates should be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding in relation to:\n\n1. biological phenomena, facts, laws, definitions, concepts, theories;\n2. biological vocabulary, terminology, conventions (including symbols, quantities and units);\n3. scientific instruments and apparatus used in biology, including techniques of operation and aspects of safety;\n4. scientific quantities and their determination;\n5. biological and technological applications with their social, economic and environmental implications.\n\nThe syllabus content defines the factual materials that candidates need to recall and explain. Questions testing the objectives above will often begin with one of the words: define, state, name, describe, explain, outline or suggest.\n\n# Skill B: Handling information and solving problems\n\nCandidates should be able to use oral, written, symbolic, graphical and numerical material to:\n\n1. locate, select, organise and present information from a variety of sources;\n\n\n\n---\n\n# 2. translate information from one form to another;\n\n# 3. manipulate numerical and other data;\n\n# 4. use information to identify patterns, report trends and draw inferences;\n\n# 5. present reasoned explanation for phenomena, patterns and relationships;\n\n# 6. make predictions and propose hypotheses;\n\n# 7. apply knowledge, including principles, to novel situations;\n\n# 8. solve problems.\n\n# Skill C.

We have deliberately kept the glossary brief, both in numbers of terms included and also in the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should be aware that the meaning of a term must depend, in part, on its context.\n\n1. Define (the term(s)…): only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase is required.\n2. State: give a concise answer with little or no supporting argument (for example, a numerical answer that can easily be obtained ‘by inspection’).\n3. List: give a number of points, generally each of one word. Do not give more points than the number specified.\n4. (a) Explain: this may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context. It is another way of asking candidates to give reasons for. The candidate needs to make sure that the examiner is told why something happens.\n\n(b) Give a reason/Give reasons: this is another way of asking candidates to explain why something happens.\n5. (a) Describe: state in words the key points that can be found from the data or information given in a graph, table or diagram. Where possible, the candidate should refer to numbers taken from the\n\n---\n\n\nmaterial.\n\n1. (b) Describe a process: give a step by step description of what happens during the process.\n\nDescribe and explain may be used together, as may state and explain.\n2. Discuss: the candidate should give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.\n3. Outline: the candidate should be brief, restricting the answer to giving essentials, without supporting details.\n4. Predict: the candidate should produce the required answer by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. The question may provide this information, or the information may depend on answers calculated in an earlier part of the question. The answer should be concise, with no supporting statement required.\n5. Deduce: the candidate should follow the guidance for predict, but a supporting statement is also required: for example, reference to a law, a principle or the necessary reasoning should be included in the answer.\n6. (a) Suggest: this may imply that there is no single correct answer (for example, in biology, there are a number of factors that might limit the rate of photosynthesis in a plant in a greenhouse).\n\n(b) Suggest: this may also imply that the candidate must apply their general knowledge and understanding of biology to a ‘novel’ situation, one that may not formally be ‘in the syllabus’. Many\n\n\n\n---\n\ndata-response and problem-solving questions are of this type.\n\n# 12. Find:\n\na general term that can be interpreted as calculate, measure, determine, etc.\n\n# 13. Calculate:\n\na numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown, especially where two or more steps are involved. The candidate should give suitable units where possible.\n\n# 14. Measure:\n\nthis implies that a suitable measuring instrument will give the quantity in question: for example, length, using a rule, or mass, using a balance. The candidate should give suitable units where possible.\n\n# 15. Determine:\n\nthis often implies that the quantity in question cannot be measured directly but must be found by calculation, placing measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula. It may also be used when the candidate must carry out a procedure to find a numerical answer. For example, the candidate might be asked to find the energy absorbed by a plant and calculate its efficiency.\n\n# 16. Estimate:\n\nthe candidate should give a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity in question, making any necessary simplifying assumptions about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.\n\n# 17. Show:\n\nthe candidate must make an algebraic deduction to prove a given equation. The candidate must make sure to state clearly the terms being used.\n\n---\n\n\n# 18.\n\n(a) Sketch, when applied to graph work: this implies that the shape and/or position of the curve only needs to be qualitatively correct. However, the candidate should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, such as passing through the origin or having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. On a sketch graph, the candidate must show clearly what is being plotted on each axis.\n\n(b) Sketch when applied to diagrams: this implies that simple, freehand drawing is allowed. However, the candidate should take care over proportions and should show important details clearly.\n\n# 19.\n\nCompare: the candidate must give both the similarities and differences between things or concepts.\n\n# 20.\n\nRecognise: the candidate should identify facts, characteristics or concepts that are relevant and/or appropriate to understanding a situation, event, process or phenomenon.\n\n# 21.\n\nClassify: the candidate should group things based on common characteristics.\n\nIn all questions, the number of marks are shown on the examination paper and candidates should use these as a guide to how much detail to give. When describing a process, the candidate should use the number of marks to decide how many steps to include. When explaining why something happens, the candidate should use the number of marks to decide how many reasons to give, or how much detail to give for each reason.\n\n# 22.\n\nEvaluate: to judge the value or condition of something in a careful and thoughtful way.\n\n\n\n---\n\nNO_CONTENT_HERE","job_metadata":{"credits_used":0,"job_credits_usage":0,"job_pages":50,"job_auto_mode_triggered_pages":0,"job_is_cache_hit":false}}
