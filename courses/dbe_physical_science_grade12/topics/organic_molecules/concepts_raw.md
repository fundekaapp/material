alkanes, carboxylic acids, and 
esters)
Describe criteria to use 
to classify elimination, 
substitution or addition 
reactions according to 
structural change
•	Addition reactions:
Unsaturated compounds 
(alkenes, cycloalkenes) 
undergo addition reactions: - Hydrohalogenation:
Addition of HX to an alkene 
e.g.  
CH2 
= CH2 
+ HCℓ → CH3 - CH2
Cℓ
Reaction conditions:  
HX (X = Cℓ, Br, I) added to 
alkene; no water must be 
present
(During addition of HX to 
unsaturated hydrocarbons, the 
H atom attaches to the C atom 
already having the greater 
number of H atoms. The X 
atom attaches to the more 
substituted C atom)- Halogenation:
Addition of X2 
(X = Cℓ, Br) to 
alkenes e.g.  
CH2 
= CH2 
+ Cℓ2
 → CH2
Cℓ-CH2
Cℓ
Reaction conditions:  
X2 
(X = Cℓ, Br) added to alkene- Hydration:
Addition of H2
O to alkenes e.g.  
CH2 
= CH2 
+ H2
O → CH3
 - CH2
OH
Reaction conditions: H2
O in 
excess and a small amount 
of HX or other strong acid 
(H3
PO4
) as catalyst
(During addition of H2
O to 
unsaturated hydrocarbons, the 
H atom attaches to the C atom 
already having the greater 
number of H atoms. The OH  
group attaches to the more 
substituted C-atom)- Hydrogenation:
Addition of H2 
to alkenes 
e.g.  
CH2 
= CH2 
+ H2
 → CH3 - CH3
Reaction conditions: alkene 
dissolved in a non polar solvent 
with the catalyst (Pt, Pd or Ni) 
in a H2
 atmosphere•	Elimination reactions:
Saturated compounds 
(haloalkanes, alcohols, 
alkanes) undergo elimination 
reactions- Dehydrohalogenation:
Elimination of HX from a 
haloalkane e.g. 
CH2
Cℓ-CH2
Cℓ → CH2 
= CHCℓ + HCℓ
Reaction conditions: heat 
under reflux (vapours 
condense and return to 
reaction vessel during heating) 
in a concentrated solution of 
NaOH or KOH in pure ethanol 
as the solvent i.e. hot ethanolic 
NaOH/KOH
(If more than one elimination 
product is possible, the major 
product is the one where the 
H atom is removed from the C 
atom with the least number of 
H atoms Dehydration of alcohols:
Elimination of H2
O from an 
alcohol e.g.  
CH3
 - CH2
OH → CH2 
= CH2 
+ 
H2
O
Reaction conditions: Acid 
catalyzed dehydration - heating 
of alcohol with an excess of 
concentrated H2
SO4
 (or H3
PO4
) 
(If more than one elimination 
product is possible, the major 
product is the one where the 
H atom is removed from the C 
atom with the least number of 
H atoms)
• Cracking of hydrocarbons:
Breaking up large hydrocarbon 
molecules into smaller and 
more useful bits
Reaction conditions: high 
pressures and temperatures 
without a catalyst (thermal 
cracking), or lower 
temperatures and pressures 
in the presence of a catalyst 
(catalytic cracking)• Substitution reactions:- Interconversion between 
alcohols and haloalkanes:
Reactions of  
HX (X = Cℓ , Br) with alcohols 
to produce haloalkanes:
Reaction conditions:-  Tertiary alcohols are 
converted into haloalkanes 
using HBr or HCℓ at room 
temperature e.g. 
C(CH3
)3
OH + HBr → C(CH3
)3
Br + H2
O- The reaction works best 
with tertiary alcohols. 
Primary and secondary 
alchohols react slowly and 
at high temperatures.  
Reactions	of	bases	with	
haloalkanes 
(Hydrolysis) to produce 
alcohols e.g.
C(CH3
)3
X + KOH → C(CH3
)3
OH + KBr
Reaction conditions: 
Haloalkane dissolved in 
ethanol before treatment with 
aqueous sodium hydroxide 
and warming th mixture; the 
same hydrolysis reation occurs 
more slowly without alkali, i.e. 
H2
O added to the haloalkane 
dissolved in ethanol. (Strong 
based will cause elimination)Reactions of bases with 
haloalkanes (hydrolysis) to 
produce alcohols e.g. 
 C(CH3
)3
X + KOH → 
C(CH3
)3
OH + KBr
Reaction conditions: 
Haloalkane dissolved in 
ethanol before treatment with 
aqueous sodium hydroxide 
and warming of the mixture;

Br, Cℓ) added to alkane in the 
presence of light or heat•	Describe addition

the reaction to produce a 
polyester. Polylactic acid 
(PLA) is an interesting polymer 
because the monomer used 
for this polymer comes from 
the biological fermentation of 
plant materials (as opposed 
to monomers coming from 
petroleum) and the polymer 
is biodegradable. This 
polymer (PLA) is mostly used 
for packaging material and

has the potential to alleviate 
land-fill disposal problems
