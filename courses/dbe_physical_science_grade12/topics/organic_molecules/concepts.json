    "title": "Addition Reactions: Types and Conditions",
    "body": "• Addition reactions: Unsaturated compounds (alkenes, cycloalkenes) undergo addition reactions:\n  - Hydrohalogenation: Addition of HX to an alkene (e.g., CH2=CH2 + HCℓ → CH3-CH2Cℓ). Reaction conditions: HX (X = Cℓ, Br, I) added to alkene; no water must be present. During addition of HX to unsaturated hydrocarbons, the H atom attaches to the C atom already having the greater number of H atoms. The X atom attaches to the more substituted C atom.\n  - Halogenation: Addition of X2 (X = Cℓ, Br) to alkenes (e.g., CH2=CH2 + Cℓ2 → CH2Cℓ-CH2Cℓ). Reaction conditions: X2 (X = Cℓ, Br) added to alkene.\n  - Hydration: Addition of H2O to alkenes (e.g., CH2=CH2 + H2O → CH3-CH2OH). Reaction conditions: H2O in excess and a small amount of HX or other strong acid (H3PO4) as catalyst. During addition of H2O to unsaturated hydrocarbons, the H atom attaches to the C atom already having the greater number of H atoms. The OH group attaches to the more substituted C-atom.\n  - Hydrogenation: Addition of H2 to alkenes (e.g., CH2=CH2 + H2 → CH3-CH3). Reaction conditions: alkene dissolved in a non-polar solvent with the catalyst (Pt, Pd or Ni) in a H2 atmosphere."

    "title": "Elimination Reactions: Types and Conditions",
    "body": "• Elimination reactions: Saturated compounds (haloalkanes, alcohols, alkanes) undergo elimination reactions:\n  - Dehydrohalogenation: Elimination of HX from a haloalkane (e.g., CH2Cℓ-CH2Cℓ → CH2=CHCℓ + HCℓ). Reaction conditions: heat under reflux in a concentrated solution of NaOH or KOH in pure ethanol as the solvent (i.e., hot ethanolic NaOH/KOH). If more than one elimination product is possible, the major product is the one where the H atom is removed from the C atom with the least number of H atoms.\n  - Dehydration of alcohols: Elimination of H2O from an alcohol (e.g., CH3-CH2OH → CH2=CH2 + H2O). Reaction conditions: Acid-catalyzed dehydration - heating of alcohol with an excess of concentrated H2SO4 (or H3PO4). If more than one elimination product is possible, the major product is the one where the H atom is removed from the C atom with the least number of H atoms.\n  - Cracking of hydrocarbons: Breaking up large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller and more useful bits. Reaction conditions: high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst (thermal cracking), or lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst (catalytic cracking)."

    "title": "Substitution Reactions: Types and Conditions",
    "body": "• Substitution reactions:\n  - Interconversion between alcohols and haloalkanes: Reactions of HX (X = Cℓ, Br) with alcohols to produce haloalkanes. Reaction conditions: Tertiary alcohols are converted into haloalkanes using HBr or HCℓ at room temperature (e.g., C(CH3)3OH + HBr → C(CH3)3Br + H2O). The reaction works best with tertiary alcohols. Primary and secondary alcohols react slowly and at high temperatures.\n  - Reactions of bases with haloalkanes (Hydrolysis) to produce alcohols (e.g., C(CH3)3X + KOH → C(CH3)3OH + KBr). Reaction conditions: Haloalkane dissolved in ethanol before treatment with aqueous sodium hydroxide and warming the mixture; the same hydrolysis reaction occurs more slowly without alkali (i.e., H2O added to the haloalkane dissolved in ethanol). (Strong bases will cause elimination).\n  - Haloalkanes from alkanes. Reaction conditions: X2 (X = Br, Cℓ) added to alkane in the presence of light or heat."

This polymer (PLA) is mostly used for packaging material and because it is biodegradable it has the potential to alleviate land-fill disposal problems.\n  n HOC(=O)R-COH + nHOCH2CH2OH → [-C(=O)R-C(=O)OCH2CH2O-]n + 2nH2O\n• Identify the monomer used to produce a polymer from the structural formula of a section of a chain.
