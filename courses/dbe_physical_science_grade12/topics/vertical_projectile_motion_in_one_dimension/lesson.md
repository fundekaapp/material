# **Lesson: One-Dimensional Projectile Motion**

### **Introduction: The Ball in the Air**

Imagine Sergio Ramos launching a powerful header, sending the ball soaring upwards before it arcs back down towards the goal. Or maybe it's a deep pass from Luka Modrić that seems to hang in the air for just the right amount of time. How does that ball behave once it leaves his head or foot? That's what we're going to explore with **one-dimensional projectile motion** – motion purely up and down.

### **Concept 1: Gravity – The Unseen Force (DBE-PS12-VPM1D-C01)**

**What it is:** When anything is launched into the air – whether it's a soccer ball, a stone, or even just you jumping – the only force acting on it (ignoring air resistance for now) is gravity. This means it experiences a constant downward acceleration, which we call 'g'.

**Key Idea:** The value of 'g' on Earth is approximately **9.8 m/s² downwards**.

**The "Inception" Rule of Gravity:** This is crucial: **Gravity's acceleration 'g' is *always* acting downwards, regardless of whether the object is moving upwards, downwards, or has momentarily stopped at its highest point.**

*   Think of it like the relentless ticking of time in a Nolan movie – it keeps pushing forward (or in this case, pulling downward) no matter what the characters are doing. When that Real Madrid ball is shot upwards, gravity isn't waiting for it to reach the peak to start pulling; it's pulling it down the *entire* time, slowing its ascent and then speeding its descent.

### **Concept 2: Time Symmetry – What Goes Up... (DBE-PS12-VPM1D-C02)**

**What it is:** For a projectile launched vertically upwards, the time it takes to reach its highest point is exactly the same as the time it takes to fall back down to its initial launch height. This perfect balance is called **time symmetry**.

**Example:** If Karim Benzema headers a ball straight up, and it takes 2 seconds to reach its maximum height, it will take another 2 seconds to fall back to the height where he headed it. Total flight time: 4 seconds.

**Kanye's Symmetrical Flow:** Imagine a Kanye West track with a perfectly balanced beat drop and build-up. The energy crescendoes, hits its peak, and then gracefully comes back down, taking the same amount of time to rise as it does to fall, creating a satisfying, symmetrical sonic experience.

### **Concept 3: Unified Equations – One Rulebook (DBE-PS12-VPM1D-C03)**

**What it is:** You don't need a separate set of equations for the "up" part of the motion and another set for the "down" part. The same set of fundamental kinematic equations describes the *entire* journey of the projectile.

**Why it's cool:** This simplifies things massively. It's like having one universal script for a complex movie scene, rather than different scripts for different parts of the action. This consistency is a hallmark of physics!

### **Concept 4: Applying Equations of Motion – Charting the Course (DBE-PS12-VPM1D-C04)**

**What it is:** We use a few powerful equations (which we'll look at in detail shortly) to calculate key aspects of the projectile's motion:
*   **Position (where it is):** Like knowing where the ball is on the field at any given moment.
*   **Velocity (how fast and in what direction it's going):** Is the ball still moving up or already coming down, and at what speed?
*   **Displacement (its change in position):** How far it has moved from its starting point.

**Think of it like:** If you want to know exactly where that Real Madrid free kick will land, how high it will go, and how fast it's moving at any point, these equations are your tools.

### **Concept 5: Graphing 1D Projectile Motion – Visualizing the Action (DBE-PS12-VPM1D-C05)**

**What it is:** We can represent the motion of a projectile using three main types of graphs:

1.  **Position vs. Time (x vs. t):** Shows the object's height (or position) over time.
2.  **Velocity vs. Time (v vs. t):** Shows how the object's speed and direction (velocity) change over time.
3.  **Acceleration vs. Time (a vs. t):** Shows how the acceleration changes over time.

**Nolan's Visual Storytelling:** Just as Christopher Nolan uses stunning visuals to tell a story in his films, these graphs are our visual storytellers for projectile motion. They let us see the whole sequence of events at a glance.

### **Concept 6: Equations for 1D Projectile Motion Graphs – The Physics Behind the Pictures (DBE-PS12-VPM1D-C06)**

These are the fundamental equations you'll use, often called the "SUVAT" equations (though we'll use slightly different letters sometimes):

1.  **`v = u + at`**
    *   **Purpose:** Relates final velocity (`v`) to initial velocity (`u`), acceleration (`a`), and time (`t`).
    *   **Graph:** This equation directly describes the **velocity vs. time (v vs. t)** graph. Since 'a' (gravitational acceleration, -9.8 m/s²) is constant, the v vs. t graph will be a straight line with a negative slope.

2.  **`Δx = ut + ½at²`**
    *   **Purpose:** Calculates the displacement (`Δx`) based on initial velocity (`u`), acceleration (`a`), and time (`t`). (Note: `Δx` is often used for displacement, and `x` for position, depending on context).
    *   **Graph:** This equation describes the **position vs. time (x vs. t)** graph. Because of the `t²` term, this graph will be a parabola. For an object thrown upwards, it will be an inverted parabola (opening downwards).

3.  **`v² = u² + 2aΔx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Useful when you don't know the time (`t`) but want to relate initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and displacement.

4.  **`Δx = (u + v)t / 2`**
    *   **Purpose:** Another way to find displacement when you have both initial and final velocities and time.

**Important Note for Projectile Motion:**
*   **`a` (acceleration) = -9.8 m/s²** (or just `g`, making sure to keep track of direction). We often use negative because "up" is usually defined as positive, and gravity pulls "down."
*   **Direction matters!** Assign a positive direction (e.g., upwards) and stick to it for all quantities (velocity, displacement, acceleration).

**Mnemonic for the Equations (Kanye-style "Stronger" acronym):**

Think of these equations helping you become **STRONG** in physics:

*   **S** (for `Δx` or `s` - displacement)
*   **T** (for `t` - time)
*   **R** (for *reaches* - like final position or velocity `v`)
*   **O** (for *origin* - like initial velocity `u`)
*   **NG** (for *gravity* - `a` = g)

Maybe remember them as the "**S.U.V.A.T.**" equations:
*   **S** = Displacement (`Δx`)
*   **U** = Initial Velocity
*   **V** = Final Velocity
*   **A** = Acceleration (`g`)
*   **T** = Time

### **Concept 7: Interpreting Graphs for Kinematic Variables – Reading the Story (DBE-PS12-VPM1D-C07)**

**What it is:** Once you have a graph, you can pull out specific information at any moment.

*   **From x vs. t graph:**
    *   **Position:** Read the y-axis value directly at a given time (x-axis).
    *   **Displacement:** `Δx = x_final - x_initial`.
    *   **Velocity:** The *slope* of the x vs. t graph gives you the instantaneous velocity.

*   **From v vs. t graph:**
    *   **Velocity:** Read the y-axis value directly at a given time.
    *   **Acceleration:** The *slope* of the v vs. t graph gives you the acceleration (which will be constant, -9.8 m/s²).
    *   **Displacement:** The *area under the curve* of the v vs. t graph gives you the displacement.

*   **From a vs. t graph:**
    *   **Acceleration:** Read the y-axis value directly. For projectile motion, it's a constant horizontal line at -9.8 m/s².

**Example:** If you see a v vs. t graph for a soccer ball thrown upwards, the point where the line crosses the x-axis (velocity = 0) tells you the *exact time* the ball reached its maximum height.

### **Concept 8: Describing Motion from Kinematic Graphs – The Director's Commentary (DBE-PS12-VPM1D-C08)**

**What it is:** Beyond just reading numbers, you need to be able to look at a graph and describe *what is happening* to the object.

*   **Ball thrown vertically upwards:**
    *   **x vs. t:** A parabola opening downwards, peaking at max height, then coming back down.
    *   **v vs. t:** A straight line with a negative slope, starting positive (upwards), crossing zero (at max height), and becoming negative (downwards).
    *   **a vs. t:** A horizontal line below the x-axis, at -9.8 m/s².

*   **Ball thrown vertically downwards:**
    *   **x vs. t:** A downward-curving line getting steeper downwards (position becoming more negative, or further from origin).
    *   **v vs. t:** A straight line with a negative slope, starting negative (or at zero if dropped) and becoming more negative.
    *   **a vs. t:** A horizontal line below the x-axis, at -9.8 m/s².

*   **Bouncing Ball (more complex!):**
    *   **x vs. t:** A series of decreasing parabolas (each bounce is a projectile motion segment, but with less height each time).
    *   **v vs. t:** A series of straight lines with negative slopes, where each "bounce" shows an instantaneous change from negative velocity (down) to positive velocity (up), with a reduced magnitude each time.
    *   **a vs. t:** Still a horizontal line at -9.8 m/s², but with spikes at each bounce (due to the impact force, which is usually ignored in simple projectile motion, but shows up on a full a vs. t graph for a bounce).

**Think of it like:** Analyzing a scene from *Interstellar*. The x vs. t graph is the overall trajectory through spacetime, the v vs. t graph is how fast they're moving at different points, and the a vs. t graph is the constant gravitational pull they're experiencing. You're not just seeing numbers; you're seeing the *story* of the object's journey.

### **Summary & Next Steps:**

You now have a solid foundation for understanding one-dimensional projectile motion!

*   Gravity (`g = 9.8 m/s²`) is the constant downward acceleration.
*   Time symmetry means ascent time equals descent time to the same height.
*   A single set of kinematic equations describes the entire motion.
*   These equations allow you to calculate position, velocity, and displacement.
*   Graphs (x vs. t, v vs. t, a vs. t) provide visual representations.
*   You can extract data and describe the motion from these graphs.

Keep practicing with examples, and you'll be able to predict the trajectory of any Real Madrid free kick with the precision of a physicist!
