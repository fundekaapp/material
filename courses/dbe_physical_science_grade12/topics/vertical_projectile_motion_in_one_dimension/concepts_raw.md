•	Explain that projectiles fall 
freely with gravitational 
acceleration ‘g’ accelerate 
downwards with a constant 
acceleration irrespective 
of whether the projectile 
is moving upward or 
downward or is at maximum 
height
•	Know that projectiles take 
the same time to reach 
their greatest height from 
the point of upward launch 
as the time they take to fall 
back to the point of launch. 
This is known as time 
symmetry 
•	Know that projectiles can 
have their motion described 
by a single set of equations 
for the upward and 
downward motion
•	Use equations of motion 
to determine the position, 
velocity and displacement 
of a projectile at any given 
time
•	Draw position vs. time (x 
vs. t), velocity vs. time (v 
vs. t) and acceleration vs. 
time (a vs. t) graphs for 1D 
projectile motion 	Give equations for position 
versus time and velocity 
versus time for the graphs 
of 1D projectile motion
•	Given x vs. t, v vs. t or a vs. 
t graphs determine position, 
displacement, velocity or 
acceleration at any time t.
•	Given x vs. t, v vs. t or a 
vs. t graphs describe the 
motion of the object e.g. 
graphs showing a ball, 
bouncing, thrown vertically 
upwards, thrown vertically 
downward, and so on
