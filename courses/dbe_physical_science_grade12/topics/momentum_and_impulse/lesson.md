# Momentum and Impulse  
**Grade 12 Physical Sciences (DBE)**

---

## 1. Momentum

### Definition of Momentum
Momentum is a measure of how difficult it is to stop a moving object.  
It is defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity.

### Formula for Momentum
The momentum \( p \) of an object is given by:

$$
p = mv
$$

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the object (in kg)
- \( v \) is the velocity of the object (in m s^{-1})

---

### Vector Nature of Momentum
Momentum is a **vector quantity**, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.  
The direction of momentum is the same as the direction of motion.

## 2. Change in Momentum

The change in momentum of an object is defined as:

$$
\Delta p = p_f - p_i
$$

---

## 3. Newton’s Second Law in Terms of Momentum

### Statement
The net force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum.

### Mathematical Form
$$
\vec{F}_{net} = \frac{\Delta \vec{p}}{\Delta t}
$$

---

## 7. Impulse

### Definition of Impulse
Impulse is defined as:

$$
J = F_{net}\Delta t
$$

---

## 8. Impulse–Momentum Theorem

$$
J = \Delta p
$$

This relationship is known as the **impulse–momentum theorem**.

## 9. Applications of Impulse in Everyday Life

Increasing the time over which momentum changes reduces the force experienced.

This principle is applied in:
- Airbags
- Seatbelts
- Arrestor beds for aircraft

## Exam Tip
In momentum and impulse problems:
1. Define the system
2. Choose a positive direction
3. Apply conservation of momentum (if the system is isolated)
4. Use the impulse–momentum theorem where forces act over time
