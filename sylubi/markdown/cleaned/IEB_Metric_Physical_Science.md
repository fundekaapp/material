# 2. School-Based Assessment (SBA)

School-based assessment comprises 25% of the total assessment for the National Senior Certificate. The minimum requirements for the school-based component of the National Senior Certificate assessment are outlined in Table 5. Where schools are able to do more than the minimum requirements then the learners may select their best work for the learner file. However, where there is a choice, the tasks should be of a comparable standard.

All schools must make available the SBA evidence of all learners should it be required by IEB or Umalusi.

These Subject Assessment Guidelines must be read in conjunction with the IEB Manual for the Moderation of School-Based Assessment available at www.ieb.co.za.

# Controlled Tests and Examinations

Controlled tests (minimum 40 minutes) and examinations are written under controlled conditions within a specified period of time. Questions in tests and examinations should assess performance at different cognitive levels. Tests may cover a specific topic or a number of topics. Preliminary examinations must mimic the final examination as closely as possible and cover almost all the prescribed topics.

# Practical Investigations and the Alternative Assessment

Learners need to spend a minimum of 2 hours on each of the practical investigations and a minimum of 1 hour on the Alternative Assessment. There needs to be contact time between the learners and the teacher to facilitate guidance, support and monitoring of the achievement of specific targets. These interactions create opportunities for teachers to:

- check for plagiarism (for example by using oral questioning)
- carry out formative assessment
- monitor progress

The teacher should guard against marking the task at these times, but should question the learner about the project and respond to queries initiated by the learner. Marking occurs once, only when the task is finally submitted.

# Practical investigations

The new FET focuses on teaching and assessing in an investigative approach.

A very simplified perspective of the investigative approach is represented in the flow chart that follows:

Observations &#x26; facts giving rise to investigative questions or identifying problems
Developing a hypothesis
Designing an experiment/(s) to test the hypothesis
Manipulating equipment, measurement &#x26; observation
Handling of data
Evaluating results considering reliability and validity within the design to draw conclusions
If results are not according to those predicted by the Theory hypothesis

# 29/8

The investigations are expected to take a minimum of 2 hours. Investigations, where possible, should include the use of physical equipment.

The following is suggested as a guide to what should be assessed in a balanced way (according to cognitive levels) across an investigation.

1. Developing a hypothesis. This could include:
- formulating a question that can be investigated.
- combining scientific ideas with observations or recorded facts.
- making predictions based on available knowledge and observations.
- writing a statement of the hypothesis.
2. Manipulation of equipment, measurement and observations. This could include:
- correct choice of equipment.
- ability to read scales accurately.
- safe use of equipment.
- meaningful observations.
3. Planning and designing. This could include:
- identifying variables to be measured and controlled.
- organising activities in an appropriate sequence.
- recognising whether or not an experiment is valid. (Will the results answer the investigative question?)
- recognising the importance of the reliability of results and planning accordingly. (Are the sample size and number of readings sufficient?)
4. Presentation of data. This could include:
- tabulating.
- graphing.
- use of data loggers and other software.
5. Analysing, concluding and evaluating. This could include:
- weighing advantages and disadvantages.
- drawing appropriate conclusions that address the hypothesis or questions.
- making/evaluating general conclusions that go beyond the experimental or given conditions.
- analysing problems to determine the relevant relationships, concepts, and problem-solving steps.
6. Communicating and presenting information. This could include:
- a written report.
- a model.
- a role-play, song, dance, speech or presentation.
- a poster.

# Alternative Assessment

This item in the portfolio allows for creativity and opportunities to allow learners to do something unconventional. The Alternative Assessment is an ideal opportunity to extend learners. The Alternative Assessment is expected to take a minimum of 1 hour.

Appropriate referencing must be emphasised in this task.

# Suggestions for Alternative Assessment tasks:

1. Debate, discussion, short essay, e.g. on ethical issues in science

The website www.peep.ac.uk has many ideas to engage learners in discussions and critical thinking about the impact of science on everyday life. Two to four topical articles can be provided as a resource to stimulate the debate, discussion or short essay.
2. Translation task

Given an article from a scientific magazine, journal, newspaper or video clip, analyse, discuss and/or answer questions and solve problems related to it.
3. Experiment

An experiment is a less demanding practical activity than a practical investigation in the following ways:

- The investigative question is posed for the learners.
- The procedure (method) may be stated as a series of instructions to the learners.
- The activity is set to take a minimum of 1 hour (and a maximum of 2 hours).

The recording of results, analysis and manipulation of data to draw conclusions remain as specified for a practical investigation. The cognitive demands of this task should include all levels of performance (Levels 1–4).
4. Simulations or video data reviews

There are a number of simulations and recorded physics-in-action videos available online. These can be analysed and interpreted to create a meaningful Alternative Assessment.
5. Metacognitive task

Tasks that ask candidates to set a test, prepare marking guidelines, and/or analyse answers for misconceptions can be used as an Alternative Assessment.

# Additional explanatory comments

- Table 6 describes the Formal Programme of Assessment and includes only summative assessment. However, formative assessment is integral to teaching and learning. It should take place regularly. In this process teachers will set many more tasks than are required for the SBA as described in Table 6 above. This is to the advantage of their learners. However, teachers may only submit the tasks requested in Table 5 and only these tasks can be taken into account when teachers calculate the SBA mark.
- Learner Files should be transferred with a learner from one school to another.
- The final SBA mark should be reported as a percentage.

| School  | The Formal Programme of Assessment should be monitored at the beginning of the year to ensure compliance with requirements. Each task which is to be used as part of the Formal Programme of Assessment should be moderated before learners attempt the task. Teacher and learner files should be monitored for compliance before submission for cluster moderation. Learners and teachers must sign a letter of authenticity to be included in the learner file. The principal signs a letter, to be included in the teacher file, stating that appropriate moderation has taken place at school level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Cluster | Teachers are required to attend two cluster meetings per year, the first before 15 March and the second by 15 September. The Formal Programme of Assessment should be monitored at the first meeting to ensure compliance with requirements and proposed tasks discussed to ensure they are of an appropriate standard. The second meeting should be used to complete cluster moderation of files. Portfolios may still be missing an item or two at this cluster meeting. It is suggested that the teachers discuss the tasks that they have set, the standard of those tasks and how they were marked. The second meeting is also an opportunity to share resources so that schools in a cluster can maintain a common standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| IEB     | Following the second cluster meeting, some schools/subjects may be regionally moderated by a moderator appointed by the IEB. A school which has been regionally moderated may not need to send portfolios for National moderation, unless either a particular problem is identified or the files are selected randomly. Complete portfolios must be submitted to Regional Moderators by mid-October. During the December National Senior Certificate marking session a moderating committee, appointed by the IEB, under the leadership of a National Moderator, carries out the following checks:- monitors the teacher file and the sample of learner files (if requested), prescribed by the IEB, for compliance, from each examination centre.
- monitors the standard of the SBA tasks.
- moderates a sample of learner tasks (the standard of the marking is checked) to ensure comparable standards across centres across the IEB.
- completes a report on the SBA work of each centre. A copy of this report is returned to the centre.
- recommends mark changes to the IEB if the marks allocated for school-based assessment at a particular centre do not reflect an appropriate standard of performance. |

# Learner's File

- Each learner must be able to produce all the work as listed in Table 5. This work is evidence of the learner's performance and justification for the marks the learner has been allocated for SBA. This work must be collected together in some convenient format that is neither expensive nor bulky. A flat folder or file or even a set of 'treasury tags' to bind the sheets together, will suffice. This folder of work constitutes the learner's file and must be available for moderation if called for by the IEB.
- For performances or the production of models, or any other situation where it is not possible to keep the products of the task, the task assessment sheet should be retained in the file. The assessment sheet in such cases should list the criteria against which the learner was assessed and give details of the performance (marks). Photographic evidence can be included.
- All the tasks in the file must be in the same sequence as the task sheets in the teacher's file for ease of moderation.
- The first page (Appendix B) in each file must give the centre number, the learner's examination number and include an index of tasks and the mark allocation for the tasks.
- The declaration of authenticity (see Appendix B) must be completed and included as the second page of the file. Ideally, candidates should complete Appendix B themselves as this provides a further check.

# Teacher's File

- Each school must submit one subject file containing the compulsory SBA requirements.
- The teacher's file must include all summative assessment task sheets or question papers with marking schemes, rubrics and marking guidelines (tests and examinations), as applicable.
- Preliminary examinations must include an Appendix A (Task Planning Sheet). Other tasks do not require an Appendix A.
- Evidence of moderation must be included for the preliminary examinations. (Evidence of moderation of all other SBA requirements must be kept at school level and available if requested for external moderation processes.)
- Teachers are expected to reference their sources on all of their Tasks and Tests.
- The teacher's file must also include a mark sheet (Appendix E) to provide evidence of all the individual marks that contribute to each component for each candidate described in Table 5. The final SBA mark should also be given as a percentage. The documentation must make it clear how the final percentage was determined. The raw score, percentage and weighted score for each task should be recorded in the mark sheet.

# Learner Absence

- Learners should be given an opportunity to make up missed tasks. If necessary, an equivalent task can be done.
- An authentic reason in writing, i.e. a doctor's letter, should be produced if a learner misses an SBA task.

# D. INTERPRETATION OF REQUIREMENTS

The purpose of the Assessment Syllabus is to assist IEB teachers in reaching a common understanding of the scope of the Curriculum and Assessment Standards (CAPS). The Assessment Syllabus is to make explicit the scaffolding of concepts and the enabling of learning over the grade 11 and grade 12 years. It is all the grade 11 and grade 12 content that is being assessed at the end of the grade 12 year. The Assessment Syllabus clearly enables assessment and supports teachers, assessors and moderators in the Physical Sciences.

# 3. Newton's First, Second and Third laws

- State Newton's first law: An object continues in a state of rest or uniform (moving with constant) velocity unless it is acted upon by a net or resultant force.
- Define inertia as the property of an object that causes it to resist a change in its state of rest or uniform motion.
- State Newton's second law: When a net force, Fnet, is applied to an object of mass, m, it accelerates in the direction of the net force. The acceleration, a, is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to the mass.
- Solve problems using: Fnet = ma.
- Apply Newton's laws to a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium problems (e.g. Discuss, using Newton's first law, why it is important to wear seatbelts).
- (e.g. Use Newton's second law to solve problems including an object moving on a horizontal/inclined plane (frictionless and rough), vertical motion (e.g. rockets, scales in lifts, hoisting masses) and also two-body systems (e.g. two masses joined by a light (negligible mass) string which may be over a pulley, two masses touching).

- State symbols need only be shown when requested

Example:

Pt(s) | Sn²⁺(aq), Sn⁴⁺(aq) || Fe³⁺(aq), Fe²⁺(aq) | Pt(s)

- If requested, standard conditions are given in brackets after:

- Aqueous solutions of ions (aq, 1 mol·dm−3)
- Gases (g, 1 atm)
- Temperature (at 25 °C) is shown at the end of the cell notation

Example:

Zn(s) | Zn²⁺(aq, 1 mol·dm−3) || Cu²⁺(aq, 1 mol·dm−3) | Cu(s) at 25 °C

# (b) Standard electrode potentials

- State the relevant specific standard conditions under which standard electrode potentials are determined for different cells
- Describe the standard hydrogen electrode and explain its role as the reference electrode
- Know that when used as a reference electrode the standard hydrogen electrode is connected as the anode (to the negative terminal of a voltmeter) even though it may not spontaneously act as the anode
- Write the cell notation for a cell in which the standard hydrogen electrode is used as a reference electrode and is therefore shown as the anode, i.e. Pt | H₂ | H⁺ || cathode
- Explain how standard electrode potentials can be determined using the reference electrode and state the convention regarding positive and negative values

NOTE: The standard hydrogen electrode will only be assessed in the context of its use as a reference electrode and therefore it will always be shown to be connected as the anode and must be shown as the anode in the cell notation for the cell. A negative emf thus indicates that the reaction does not occur spontaneously in the direction given in the cell notation. The anode half-reaction, cathode half-reaction and net cell reaction must always be written for the spontaneous reaction regardless of how the standard hydrogen electrode is connected.

- State that once a galvanic cell reaches chemical equilibrium or has run to completion the voltage of the cell equals zero.
- Qualitatively, using Le Châtelier's principle, predict the effect of changing concentration on the voltage of a galvanic cell. (i.e. all the factors that favour the forward reaction increase the voltage of the galvanic cell and factors that favour the reverse reaction decrease the voltage. E.g. Increasing the concentration of the reactants or decreasing the concentration of the products increases voltage.)
- Know that internal resistance is opposition to the flow of charge through the electrodes and electrolytes in a cell.
- State that increased surface area of the electrodes increases the rate of the reaction by lowering the internal resistance and increasing the maximum current that the cell can deliver, but does not affect the emf of the cell.

| Alkenes           | Carbon-carbon double bond                   | C=C                       |                  |

# 2. IUPAC Naming and Formulae; Isomers

• Write the IUPAC name when given the formula of compounds in the following homologous series: alkanes, alkenes, haloalkanes, alcohols, carboxylic acids and esters (up to 8 carbon atoms in the parent chain)

NOTE the following for naming purposes:

- Naming and drawing of organic compounds is restricted to one type of functional group per compound and to a maximum of two functional groups of the same type per compound, except for haloalkanes, where a maximum of two different halogen substituents (e.g. bromo- and chloro-) are allowed per molecule.
- The only substituent chains that are allowed in naming and reactions are: methyl- and ethyl- groups.
- A maximum of THREE substituent chains (alkyl substituents) are allowed on the alkane, alkene, haloalkane, alcohol or carboxylic acid parent chain. No substituent chains are allowed on esters.
- When naming haloalkanes, the halogen atoms do not get preference over alkyl groups – numbering should start from the end nearest to the first substituent, either the alkyl group or the halogen. In haloalkanes, where e.g. a Br and a Cl have the same number when numbered from different ends of the chain, Br gets alphabetical preference.
- When writing IUPAC names, substituents appear as prefixes written alphabetically (bromo-, chloro-, ethyl-, methyl-), ignoring the prefixes di- and tri-.
- When writing IUPAC names, the following conventions must be followed:
- Numbers are separated from letters using an en dash (−).
- Numbers are separated from numbers using a comma (,).
- Letters are not separated at all (i.e. no space is used), with the exceptions being esters (e.g. methyl ethanoate) and carboxylic acids (e.g. propanoic acid).
- In some (especially smaller) molecules numbering becomes redundant, but redundancy will not be penalised. For example, methylbut−2−ene may be written as 2−methylbut−2−ene without penalty. The only exception to this is if numbering is always redundant, e.g. for a carboxylic acid: butan−1−oic acid will be penalised, as it must be written as butanoic acid.
- For euphonic purposes, the vowel "e" is generally removed from the name before the suffix, e.g. butan−1−ol instead of butane−1−ol. However, this is not done for diols, e.g. butane−1,2−diol is correct, and not butan−1,2−diol.
- For euphonic purposes, the vowel "a" must be added to the name before the suffix for dienes, e.g. buta−1,3−diene is correct, and not but−1,3−diene.

# 29/61

# (b) Substitution Reactions (GENERAL type)

When given the appropriate reaction conditions, write balanced equations to show the formation of substitution products in the following SPECIFIC types of substitution reactions:

- Halogenation: alkanes to haloalkanes
- e.g. CH₄ + Cℓ₂ → CH₃Cℓ + HCℓ (Reaction condition: in the presence of ultraviolet light or heat)

- Know what 'heating under reflux' entails and explain why this is necessary

# (c) Addition Reactions (GENERAL type)

When given the appropriate reaction conditions write balanced equations to show the formation of addition products in the following SPECIFIC types of addition reactions:

- Hydrogenation: addition of H₂ to any alkene
- e.g. CH₂=CH₂ + H₂ → CH₃–CH₃ (Reaction condition: alkene dissolved in an organic solvent with a Pt, Pd or Ni catalyst in a H₂ atmosphere)
- Halogenation: addition of X₂ (X = Cℓ, Br)
- e.g. CH₂=CH₂ + Cℓ₂ → CH₂Cℓ–CH₂Cℓ
- Know that rapid decolourisation of bromine water by an alkene at room temperature is used to distinguish an alkene from an alkane (test for unsaturation). Since alkenes are more reactive than alkanes, addition reactions occur faster than substitution reactions.
- Hydrohalogenation: addition of HX to any alkene
- e.g. CH₂=CH₂ + HCℓ → CH₃–CH₂Cℓ (Reaction condition: no water may be present)
- Hydration: addition of H₂O to any alkene

# 29/62

# (d) Elimination Reactions (GENERAL type)

• When given the appropriate reaction conditions write balanced equations to show the formation of elimination products in the following SPECIFIC types of elimination reactions:

- Dehydrohalogenation: elimination of HX from any haloalkane
- e.g. CH₃–CH₂Cℓ → CH₂=CH₂ + HCℓ
- OR: CH₃-CH₂Cℓ + KOH → CH₂=CH₂ + KCℓ + H₂O (Reaction condition: hot concentrated solution of NaOH or KOH in an ethanol solvent i.e. in the absence of water; the amount of water produced in the second reaction is insufficient to cause hydrolysis)
- Dehydration: elimination of H₂O from any alcohol
- e.g. CH₃–CH₂OH → CH₂=CH₂ + H₂O (Reaction condition: acid catalysed dehydration – heating of alcohol with an excess of concentrated H₂SO₄ or H₃PO₄)
- Cracking of hydrocarbons: breaking up large alkane molecules to form a mixture of smaller and more useful alkane and alkene molecules
- Reaction conditions:
- thermal cracking – high pressures and temperatures without a catalyst
- catalytic cracking – lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst

Note: When two elimination products are possible, either will be accepted.
