# FOREWORD by the MINISTER

Our national curriculum is the culmination of our efforts over a period of seventeen years to transform the curriculum bequeathed to us by apartheid. From the start of democracy we have built our curriculum on the values that inspired our Constitution (Act 108 of 1996). The Preamble to the Constitution states that the aims of the Constitution are to:

- heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights;
- improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person;
- lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally protected by law;
- build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as a sovereign state in the family of nations.

Education and the curriculum have an important role to play in realising these aims. In 1997 we introduced outcomes-based education to overcome the curricular divisions of the past, but the experience of implementation prompted a review in 2000. This led to the first curriculum revision: the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 and the National Curriculum Statement Grades 10-12 (2002).

Ongoing implementation challenges resulted in another review in 2009 and we revised the Revised National Curriculum Statement (2002) and the National Curriculum Statement Grades 10-12 to produce this document. From 2012 the two national Curriculum statements, for Grades R-9 and Grades 10-12 respectively, are combined in a single document and will simply be known as the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12. The National Curriculum Statement for Grades R-12 builds on the previous curriculum but also updates it and aims to provide clearer specification of what is to be taught and learnt on a term-by-term basis.

The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 represents a policy statement for learning and teaching in South African schools and comprises of the following:

1. Curriculum and Assessment Policy statements (CAPs) for all approved subjects listed in this document;
2. National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12;
3. National Protocol for Assessment Grades R-12.

MINISTER OF BASIC EDUCATION

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

# SECTION 1

# Introduction to the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements for Life Sciences Grades 10-12

# 1.1 Background

The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 (NCS) stipulates policy on curriculum and assessment in the schooling sector.
To improve implementation, the National Curriculum Statement was amended, with the amendments coming into effect in January 2012.
A single comprehensive Curriculum and Assessment Policy document was developed for each subject to replace Subject Statements,
Learning Programme Guidelines and Subject Assessment Guidelines in Grades R-12.

# 1.2 Overview

(a) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 (January 2012) represents a policy statement for learning and teaching in South African schools and comprises the following:

- (i) Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements for each approved school subject;
- (ii) The policy document, National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12; and
- (iii) The policy document, National Protocol for Assessment Grades R-12 (January 2012).

(b) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 (January 2012) replaces the two current national curricula statements, namely the

- (i) Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9, Government Gazette No. 23406 of 31 May 2002, and
- (ii) National Curriculum Statement Grades 10-12 Government Gazettes, No. 25545 of 6 October 2003 and No. 27594 of 17 May 2005.

(c) The national curriculum statements contemplated in subparagraphs b(i) and (ii) comprise the following policy documents which will be incrementally repealed by the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 (January 2012) during the period 2012-2014:

- (i) The Learning Area/Subject Statements, Learning Programme Guidelines and Subject Assessment Guidelines for Grades R-9 and Grades 10-12;
- (ii) The policy document, National Policy on assessment and qualifications for schools in the General Education and Training Band, promulgated in Government Notice No. 124 in Government Gazette No. 29626 of 12 February 2007;
- (iii) The policy document, the National Senior Certificate: A qualification at Level 4 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), promulgated in Government Gazette No.27819 of 20 July 2005;

(iv) The policy document, An addendum to the policy document, the National Senior Certificate: A qualification at Level 4 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), regarding learners with special needs, published in Government Gazette, No.29466 of 11 December 2006, is incorporated in the policy document, National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12; and

(v) The policy document, An addendum to the policy document, the National Senior Certificate: A qualification at Level 4 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), regarding the National Protocol for Assessment (Grades R-12), promulgated in Government Notice No.1267 in Government Gazette No. 29467 of 11 December 2006.

(d) The policy document, National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12, and the sections on the Curriculum and Assessment Policy as contemplated in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this document constitute the norms and standards of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12. It will therefore, in terms of section 6A of the South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act No. 84 of 1996,) form the basis for the Minister of Basic Education to determine minimum outcomes and standards, as well as the processes and procedures for the assessment of learner achievement to be applicable to public and independent schools.

# 1.3 General aims of the South African Curriculum

(a) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 gives expression to the knowledge, skills and values worth learning in South African schools. This curriculum aims to ensure that children acquire and apply knowledge and skills in ways that are meaningful to their own lives. In this regard, the curriculum promotes knowledge in local contexts, while being sensitive to global imperatives.

(b) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 serves the purposes of:

- equipping learners, irrespective of their socio-economic background, race, gender, physical ability or intellectual ability, with the knowledge, skills and values necessary for self-fulfilment, and meaningful participation in society as citizens of a free country;
- providing access to higher education;
- facilitating the transition of learners from education institutions to the workplace; and
- providing employers with a sufficient profile of a learner’s competences.

(c) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 is based on the following principles:

- Social transformation: ensuring that the educational imbalances of the past are redressed, and that equal educational opportunities are provided for all sections of the population;
- Active and critical learning: encouraging an active and critical approach to learning, rather than rote and uncritical learning of given truths;
- High knowledge and high skills: the minimum standards of knowledge and skills to be achieved at each grade are specified and set high, achievable standards in all subjects;
- Progression: content and context of each grade shows progression from simple to complex;

4 CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)

---


LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

• Human rights, inclusivity, environmental and social justice: infusing the principles and practices of social and environmental justice and human rights as defined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 is sensitive to issues of diversity such as poverty, inequality, race, gender, language, age, disability and other factors;

• Valuing indigenous knowledge systems: acknowledging the rich history and heritage of this country as important contributors to nurturing the values contained in the Constitution; and

• Credibility, quality and efficiency: providing an education that is comparable in quality, breadth and depth to those of other countries.

(d) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 aims to produce learners that are able to:

- identify and solve problems and make decisions using critical and creative thinking;
- work effectively as individuals and with others as members of a team;
- organise and manage themselves and their activities responsibly and effectively;
- collect, analyse, organise and critically evaluate information;
- communicate effectively using visual, symbolic and/or language skills in various modes;
- use science and technology effectively and critically showing responsibility towards the environment and the health of others; and
- demonstrate an understanding of the world as a set of related systems by recognising that problem solving contexts do not exist in isolation.

(e) Inclusivity should become a central part of the organisation, planning and teaching at each school. This can only happen if all teachers have a sound understanding of how to recognise and address barriers to learning, and how to plan for diversity.

The key to managing inclusivity is ensuring that barriers are identified and addressed by all the relevant support structures within the school community, including teachers, District-Based Support Teams, Institutional-Level Support Teams, parents and Special Schools as Resource Centres. To address barriers in the classroom, teachers should use various curriculum differentiation strategies such as those included in the Department of Basic Education’s Guidelines for Inclusive Teaching and Learning (2010).

# 2.1 What is life sciences?

‘Life Sciences’ is the scientific study of living things from molecular level to their interactions with one another and their environments. To be accepted as a science, it is necessary to use certain methods for broadening existing knowledge, or discovering new things. These methods must lend themselves to replication and a systematic approach to scientific inquiry. The methods include formulating hypotheses and carrying out investigations and experiments as objectively as possible to test these hypotheses. Repeated investigations are carried out and adapted. The methods and results are analysed, evaluated and debated before the community of scientists accepts them as valid.

Knowledge production in science is an ongoing endeavour that usually happens gradually but, occasionally, knowledge and insights take a leap forward as new knowledge, or a new theory, replaces what was previously accepted. As with all knowledge, scientific knowledge changes over time as scientists improve their knowledge and understanding and as people change their views of the world around them. Scientific investigations are mostly about things that are poorly understood or not understood at all. Scientists are frequently involved in debates and disagreements. As more people take on such investigations, they tend to reach consensus about the ways in which the world works. The science theory that is taught in schools has been tested and is generally accepted. A good teacher will inform learners of debates and arguments among the scientists who were the first to investigate a phenomenon.

Scientists continue to explore the unknown. They tackle questions to which no-one has definite answers, such as: ‘Why is the climate changing?’; ‘What is causing the universe to expand?’; ‘What causes the Earth’s magnetic field to change?’; and ‘What, exactly, is the human mind?’. No one knows for sure.

By studying and learning about Life Sciences, learners will develop:

- their knowledge of key biological concepts, processes, systems and theories;
- an ability to critically evaluate and debate scientific issues and processes;
- greater awareness of the ways in which biotechnology and knowledge of Life Sciences have benefited humankind;
- an understanding of the ways in which humans have impacted negatively on the environment and organisms living in it;
- a deep appreciation of the unique diversity of past and present biomes in Southern Africa and the importance of conservation;
- an awareness of what it means to be a responsible citizen in terms of the environment and life-style choices that they make;
- an awareness of South African scientists’ contributions;
- scientific skills and ways of thinking scientifically that enable them to see the flaws in pseudo-science in popular media;

Life Sciences is the study of life at various levels of organisation and comprises a variety of sub-disciplines, or specialisations, such as:

- Biochemistry;
- Biotechnology;
- Microbiology;
- Genetics;
- Zoology;
- Botany;
- Entomology;
- Physiology (plant and animal);
- Anatomy (plant and animal);
- Morphology (plant and animal);
- Taxonomy (plant and animal);
- Environmental Studies; and
- Sociobiology (animal behaviour).

At school level, all of these sub-disciplines are introduced, to varying degrees, to provide a broad overview of the subject, Life Sciences. The three main reasons for taking Life Sciences are:

- to provide useful knowledge and skills that are needed in everyday life
- to expose learners to the scope of biological studies to stimulate interest in and create awareness of possible specialisations; and
- to provide a sufficient background for further studies in one or more of the biological sub-disciplines.

# 2.3 the organisation of the life sciences Curriculum

The Life Sciences content framework is organised according to four ‘knowledge strands’. Knowledge strands are developed progressively over the three years of FET. These knowledge strands are:

- Knowledge Strand 1: Life at the Molecular, Cellular and Tissue Level;
- Knowledge Strand 2: Life Processes in Plants and Animals

CAPS                                                                                                            9

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

• Knowledge Strand 3: Environmental Studies;

• Knowledge Strand 4: Diversity, Change and Continuity.

These Knowledge Strands and the topics within each knowledge strand should not be studied separately or independently. The Knowledge Strands do not need to be taught in the same sequence each year, nor do all four Knowledge Strands have to be covered in each year. This categorisation is simply a tool for organising the subject content and they are also not weighted equally. When teaching Life Sciences, it is very important to help learners to recognise the links between related topics so that they acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and interconnectedness of life. These links must also be made across grades.

The content framework focuses on ideas, skills and concepts as well as connections between them, rather than on listing the facts and procedures that need to be learned. It also does not prescribe particular instructional strategies or methodologies. Instead, educators have the freedom to expand concepts and to design and organise learning experiences according to their local circumstances, including the availability of resources.

10 CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

In Grade 10, all four Knowledge Strands are addressed and serve to introduce learners to the four strands. The recommended Grade 10 teaching sequence for the four Knowledge Strands is:

1. Life at Molecular, Cellular and Tissue level (Molecules to organs)
2. Life Processes in Plants and Animals (Processes that sustain life)
3. Environmental Studies (Biosphere to Ecosystems)
4. Diversity, Change and Continuity (History of Life on Earth)

The rationale for this order in Grade 10 is that some areas of South Africa are best suited for an environmental study during early spring and also because seasonal comparisons in a chosen ecosystem are required where possible. Some teachers may elect to deal with the Environmental Study at the beginning of the year. However, it is important to retain the sequence of Knowledge Strand 1 before Knowledge Strand 2 and Knowledge Strand 3 before Knowledge Strand 4. Decisions regarding the sequence (starting the year with Knowledge Strands 1 and 2 or starting the year with Knowledge Strands 3 and 4) must be made by teachers.

The first section in Grade 10, called “Subject Orientation”, is designed to prepare learners for the FET phase, and is intended to:

- connect what learners learned in the GET (Natural Sciences) with what they will be learning in the FET (Life Sciences). The Life Sciences subject builds on knowledge and skills acquired from the Life Sciences knowledge areas in GET.
- describe how knowledge is built/constructed in science, and introduces the scientific approach that both teachers and learners are required to use when teaching and learning Life Sciences.
- introduce learners to some basic principles related to science.
- familiarise learners with the range of skills that they will need to develop.

The orientation should be done in the first lessons as an introduction but is not part of the assessable curriculum although the principles and skills will be assessed in the context of specific content during the year. Learners will have been exposed to similar orientations at the start of the Senior Phase (Grade 7) and at the start of High School (Grade 8). The orientation on Grade 10 should then simply remind learners of what is expected of them and expand on some of the aspects.

In Grade 11, three of the four Knowledge Strands are addressed and serve to ensure progression. The content described in Life at Molecular, Cellular and Tissue level in Grade 10 is used to understand Life Processes in Plant and Animals in Grade 11 but it is not taught as a separate strand in Grade 11. The recommended Grade 11 teaching sequence for the three Knowledge Strands is:

1. Diversity, Change and Continuity (Microorganisms, Plants and Animals)
2. Life Processes in Plants and Animals (Processes that sustain life)
3. Environmental Studies (Population Ecology and Human Impact)

CAPS 11

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

In Grade 12, three of the four Knowledge Strands are addressed and serve to ensure progression. The content described in Environmental Studies: Human Impacts (Current Crises) is dealt with in Grade 11 in order to lessen the pressure in Grade 12 but this Knowledge Strand will be examined in the National Senior Certificate examination at the end of Grade 12.

The recommended Grade 12 teaching sequence for the four Knowledge Strands is:

1. Life at Molecular, Cellular and Tissue level (DNA and protein synthesis)
2. Life Processes in Plants and Animals (Processes that sustain life)
3. Diversity, Change and Continuity (Darwinism and Human Evolution)
4. Environmental Studies (Human Impact, taught and assessed in Grade 11)

The identified range of cognitive and practical skills must be taught, and assessed, in an integrated way in the context provided by the topics in the four Knowledge Strands in each year in the FET band.

# 2.4 The Purpose of studying life sciences

- The development of Scientific Knowledge and Understanding
Scientific knowledge and understanding can be used to answer questions about the nature of the living world around us. It can prepare learners for economic activity and self-expression and it lays the basis of further studies in science and prepares learners for active participation in a democratic society that values human rights and promotes acting responsibly towards the environment.
- The Development of Science Process Skills (Scientific Investigations)
The teaching and learning of science involves the development of a range of process skills that may be used in everyday life, in the community and in the workplace. Learners can gain these skills in an environment that supports creativity, responsibility and growing confidence. Learners develop the ability to think objectively and use different types of reasoning while they use process skills to investigate, reflect, synthesise and communicate.
- The Development of an Understanding of Science’s Roles in society
Both science and technology have made a major impact, both positive and negative, on our world. A careful selection of scientific content and the use of a variety of methods to teach and learn science should promote the understanding of science as a human activity as well as the history of science and the relationship between Life Sciences and other subjects. It also helps learners to understand the contribution of science to social justice and societal development as well as the need for using scientific knowledge responsibly in the interest of ourselves, society and the environment. Moreover, understanding science also helps us to understand the consequences of decisions that involve ethical issues.

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

# 2.5 Specific Aims

There are three broad subject-specific aims in Life Sciences which relate to the purposes of learning science. These are:

1. Specific Aim 1, which relates to knowing the subject content (‘theory’);
2. Specific Aim 2, which relates to doing science or practical work and investigations; and
3. Specific Aim 3, which relates to understanding the applications of Life Sciences in everyday life, as well as understanding the history of scientific discoveries and the relationship between indigenous knowledge and science.

# What do the three aims mean and how do they relate to assessment?

# 2.5.1 Specific Aim 1: Knowing Life Sciences

(life sciences concepts, processes, phenomena, mechanisms, principles, theories, laws, models, etcetera).

Specific Aim 1 involves knowing, understanding, and making meaning of sciences, thereby enabling learners to make many connections between the ideas and concepts. Making such connections makes it possible for learners to apply their knowledge in new and unfamiliar contexts. The process of acquiring a deep understanding of science is about more than just knowing a lot of facts. The scope of knowledge that learners should acquire includes knowledge of the process skills related to carrying out investigations.

The following cognitive (thinking) skills comprise the range of skills that all learners should develop by working through the curriculum in a school year. These skills indicate what should be assessed at the appropriate grade level in a variety of different kinds of assessments. Note that not every skill is assessed in every assessment, but that teachers must ensure that, by the end of the year, the assessments provide evidence that the range of different skills have been assessed for each learner.

# 2.5.1.1 Acquire Knowledge

In the process of acquiring knowledge learners must:

- access information from a variety of sources (teachers, reference books, textbooks, internet, experts, peers, parents, etc.);
- select key ideas;
- recall facts; and
- describe concepts, processes, phenomena, mechanisms, principles, theories, laws and models in Life Sciences.

# Assessment

In order to assess these competences (or cognitive skills), teachers should use the following verbs in the tasks or assessments that they set: state, name, label, list, define, describe and any other verbs that indicate that learners’ knowledge of the subject is being assessed.

CAPS 13

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

# 2.5.1.2 Understand and make Connections Between ideas and Concepts to make meaning of life sciences

In the process of making meaning and achieving understanding learners must:

- build a conceptual framework of science ideas;
- organise or reorganise knowledge to derive new meaning;
- write summaries;
- develop flow charts, diagrams and mind maps; and
- recognise patterns and trends.

# Assessment

In order to assess these competencies (cognitive skills), teachers should use the following verbs in the tasks or assessments they set: explain, compare, rearrange, give an example of, illustrate, calculate, interpret, suggest a reason, make a generalisation, interpret information or data, predict, select, differentiate or any other suitable verbs that indicate that learners’ understanding of the subject is being assessed.

# 2.5.1.3 Apply knowledge on life sciences in new and unfamiliar Contexts

learners must be able to:

- use information in a new way; and
- apply knowledge to new and unfamiliar contexts.

# Assessment

In order to assess these competencies (cognitive skills), teachers should use the following verbs in the tasks or assessments that they set: demonstrate, interpret, predict, compare, differentiate, illustrate, solve and select as well as any other appropriate verbs that assess a learner’s ability to apply knowledge. The key is that learners must be able to apply knowledge in a context or situation for which they have not yet acquired specific knowledge, or use the knowledge in a new way.

# 2.5.1.4 Analyse, Evaluate and Synthesise Scientific Knowledge, Concepts and Ideas

In the process of learning science, learners must be able to:

- analyse information/data;
- recognise relationships between existing knowledge and new ideas;
- critically evaluate scientific information;
- identify assumptions; and
- categorise information.

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12
# assessment

In order to assess these competencies (cognitive skills), teachers should use the following verbs in the tasks or assessments that they set: appraise, argue, judge, select, evaluate, defend (a point of view), compare, contrast, criticise (an argument or assumption) differentiate, distinguish, discuss or any other suitable verbs that indicate that analysis, evaluation and synthesis are being assessed.

# 2.5.2  Specific Aim 2: Investigating Phenomena in Life Sciences

Learners must be able to plan and carry out investigations as well as solve problems that require some practical ability. This ability is underpinned by an attitude of curiosity and an interest in wanting to find out how the natural world and living things in it work.

The following range of skills relates to doing practical work in Life Sciences. All seven skills will not apply to every activity equally. The skills are aligned to what learners would be doing in the normal course of carrying out an investigation. Teachers must select those skills that apply to and can be assessed in the context of specific activities. By the end of the Grade 10 year, all seven skills must have been assessed at a grade-appropriate level.

note: While doing practical investigations involves a specific range of skills, learners’ knowledge on and understanding of science can, and should, be assessed within the context of the cognitive domains of Specific Aim 1.

# Learners must be able to:

# 2.5.2.1 follow instructions

This is essential, especially in the lower grades and in large classes. Teachers cannot expect all learners to use unfamiliar equipment and to do so independently without giving them a clear set of instructions to follow. The amount of assistance required would indicate the level of performance in this regard. Adherence to safety rules should be part of this.

# 2.5.2.2 Handle equipment or apparatus

This should include having knowledge of the apparatus, that is, being able to name it and knowing what it is used for. The learner should be able to use different kinds of equipment. ‘Handling equipment’ is a generic skill and applies to any equipment used for many different kinds of investigations. Handling improvised equipment requires the same skills as would be required for handling standard laboratory equipment. The emphasis is on using equipment appropriately and safely (and not on only memorising the names of apparatus).

# 2.5.2.3 make observations

A variety of observations are possible and observations can be recorded in different ways, such as:

- drawings;
- descriptions;
- grouping of materials or examples based on observable similarities and/or differences;
- measurements;
- comparing materials before and after treatment;

CAPS 15

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

• observing results of an experimental investigation which will involve recording information in an appropriate way; and

• counting.

# 2.5.2.4 record information or data

This should include recording observations or information as drawings, descriptions, in simple table format, as simple graphs, etc. The skill of ‘recording’ is transferable across a range of different scientific activities.

# 2.5.2.5 measure

Learners should know what to measure, how to measure it and have a sense of the degree of accuracy that is required. A variety of things could be measured including (but not limited to) length, volume, temperature, weight or mass and numbers (counting). Measuring is a way of quantifying observations and in this process learners should learn to make estimations.

# 2.5.2.6 interpret

Learners should be able to convert information from one form, in which it was recorded, into another, for instance converting a table into an appropriate graph.

Learners should be able to perform appropriate simple calculations, to analyse and extract information from tables and graphs, apply knowledge of theory to practical situations, recognise patterns and/or trends, appreciate the limitations of experimental procedures as well as make deductions based on evidence.

# 2.5.2.7 design/Plan investigations or experiments

Not all investigations are based on the ‘classic’ dependent-independent variables and controls. For example, an investigation could involve observing soil profiles or counting populations.

Designing an investigation is a different process to planning an investigation. In the design process options need to be considered in terms of the hypothesis and variables may have to be identified.

Skills include:

- identifying a problem;
- hypothesising;
- selecting apparatus or equipment and/or materials;
- identifying variables;
- suggesting ways of controlling variables;
- planning an experiment;
- suggesting ways of recording results; and
- understanding the need for replication or verification.

In Grades 10, 11 and 12, learners must be able to plan and/or design a simple investigation or experiment.

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

Note: Skills 2.5.2.1-2.5.2.6 (following instructions, handling equipment, making observations, recording information, measuring and interpreting information) are all required, in one form or another, to carry out an experiment or investigation. By separating seven different kinds of skills (2.5.2.1-2.5.2.7), these skills can apply to the variety of practical work that is appropriate for a particular grade in Life Sciences, including simple investigations or experiments. This approach makes it easier to assess learners in a range of different circumstances and it enables a teacher to judge a learner’s ability to do science. The skills are based on what learners will be doing actions during the normal course of doing practical work. However, there are some circumstances in which only some of these skills would apply and not every skill can be assessed in every practical task.

# 2.5.3 Specific Aim 3: Appreciating and Understanding the History, Importance and Applications of Life Sciences in Society

The third aim of Life Sciences is to enable learners to understand that school science can be relevant to their lives outside of the school and that it enriches their lives.

Learners must be exposed to the history of science and indigenous knowledge systems from other times and other cultures. Scientific knowledge and understanding have been developed over time by people who were curious and who persevered with their quest for knowledge. Our present understanding of science will change and improve as modern scientists make new discoveries.

The skills that can be developed in the process of achieving Specific Aim 3 are cognitive rather than practical. These are the same cognitive skills as the ones identified for Specific Aim 1.

Since the knowledge that will be acquired in respect of Specific Aim 3 always relates to specific subject content, the content provides the context for learning about various aspects of science in society. Science should therefore be taught in an integrated way in order to both enhance the subject and to clarify the relationship between the subject and society i.e. indigenous knowledge systems that relate to a specific topic, related history of scientific discoveries and the applications of science in everyday life.

# 2.5.3.1 Understanding the History and Relevance of Some Scientific Discoveries

The subject content provides the context for learning about the history of scientific discoveries and their relevance for society. These aspects, the history and relevance, should be linked to and taught in conjunction with the topics and content that are related to a particular discovery or a particular scientist.

# 2.5.3.2 The Relationship Between Indigenous Knowledge and Life Sciences

All knowledge stems from views on how the world works. One of the differences between modern science (and technology) and traditional, indigenous knowledge systems is that they have their origins in different world views. Learners should understand the different cultural contexts in which indigenous knowledge systems were developed. The examples of indigenous knowledge that are selected for study should, as far as possible, reflect different South African cultural groups. They should also link directly to specific areas in the Life Sciences subject content.

# 2.5.3.3 The Value and Application of Life Sciences Knowledge in the Industry in Respect of Career Opportunities and in Everyday Life

Knowledge of Life Sciences is applied in and relevant to various aspects of society. Examples should be relevant to the subject content that learners are dealing with at a particular time. There are career opportunities in the field of socio-biology and animal behaviour, plant pathology, game management, environmental impact studies, preservation.

CAPS 17

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12
of biodiversity, palaeontology, palaeoanthropology, agriculture, horticulture, environmental law, science journalism, biotechnology, genetic engineering, and many others. Moreover, although learners should be made aware of career choices, it is not necessary to discuss or teach these in great detail.

# skills

Whilst the kind of knowledge is different for Specific Aims 1 and 3, the content should be taught in an integrated way in order for learners to understand the history, relevance and applications of science more easily. Importantly, the skills that must be developed and assessed for Specific Aim 3 are the same as those of Specific Aim 1 (under 2.5). Learners must be able to:

- access information;
- select key ideas;
- recall information; Specific Aim 1.1
- describe knowledge of natural sciences;
- build a conceptual framework;
- organise or reorganise knowledge;
- write summaries; Specific Aim 1.2
- develop flow charts and mind maps;
- recognise patterns and trends;
- apply knowledge in new contexts;
- use knowledge in a new way; Specific Aim 1.3
- analyse information/data;
- critically evaluate scientific information;
- recognise relationships between existing knowledge and new ideas; Specific Aim 1.4
- identify assumptions; and
- categorise information.

The three aims are aligned with the three learning outcomes with which teachers are familiar. Within each of these aims, specific skills or competences have been identified. It is not advisable to try to assess each of the skills separately, nor is it possible to report on individual skills separately. However, well designed assessments must show evidence that, by the end of the year, all of the skills have been assessed at a grade-appropriate level.

There must be a clear link between the aims and the outcomes of learning. The processes of teaching, learning and assessment will provide the links between the specific aims and the achievement of the outcomes.

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

# 2.5.4 Developing Language Skills: Reading and Writing

Teachers of Life Sciences should be aware that they are also engaged in teaching language across the curriculum. This is particularly important for learners for whom the Language of Learning and Teaching (LoLT) is not their home language. It is important to provide learners with opportunities to develop and improve their language skills in the context of learning Life Sciences. It will therefore be critical to afford learners opportunities to read scientific texts and to write reports, paragraphs and short essays as part of the assessment, especially in (but not limited to) the informal assessments for learning.

# 2.6 Time

The time allocation for Life Sciences is 4 hours per week in Grades 10 to 12. The curriculum for Grade 10 has been designed to be completed within 32 weeks out of 40 weeks in the school year. This leaves 8 weeks in the year for examinations, tests and disruptions due to other school activities.

The curriculum for Grade 11 has been designed to be completed within 32 weeks out of 40 weeks in the school year. This leaves 8 weeks in the year for examinations, tests and disruptions due to other school activities.

The curriculum for Grade 12 has been designed to be completed within 27½ weeks out of 40 weeks in the school year. This leaves 12½ weeks in the year for examinations, tests and disruptions due to other school activities.

In Grades 10, 11 and 12 the time allocated for the teaching of the content includes the practical tasks and investigations. These are an integral part of the teaching and learning process.

# 2.7 Resources

The resources needed for teaching Life Sciences are listed next to each topic in order to assist teachers with planning and preparation. Every learner must have his or her own textbook. Teachers should ensure that a system is in place for recovering textbooks at the end of every year. Schools must provide secure storage space where textbooks and other equipment can be stored safely.

Ideally, every learner should have access to sufficient workspace and equipment to carry out investigations. For safety reasons, no more than three learners may share space and equipment in instances where space and equipment are limited due to large classes. With regard to equipment, schools must make every effort to ensure that the essential equipment is provided.

While it is acknowledged that it is not ideal to use improvised equipment, teachers should remember that it is more important for learners to have the experience of carrying out a variety of investigations than to depend on the availability of standard laboratory equipment. If equipment is limited, teachers should be encouraged to improvise. The same skills can be developed using improvised equipment. Moreover, if there are no alternatives, it is more effective for teachers to demonstrate an investigation than to not do investigations at all due to a lack of equipment.

Secure storage for equipment and chemicals must be provided by the school. Teachers should ensure that learners are familiar with rules regarding the safe use of equipment and chemicals. The Life Sciences classroom or laboratory should be equipped with charts, Bunsen burners or spirit lamps, hand lenses, bioviewers and relevant biostrips, microscopes, a set of prepared slides, glass slides and cover slips, reference.

CAPS 19

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12
books, blades or scalpels, models, field guides, identification keys, thermometers, glass beakers, test tubes and chemicals, and, if at all possible, access to appropriate DVDs and a DVD player.

Fresh plant material can be obtained from the surroundings and teachers should ensure that appropriate plants (e.g., Impatiens) are planted on the school grounds. Fresh animal material can very often be obtained at reasonable prices from local butchers.

Teachers must be qualified to teach the subject and must familiarise themselves with the equipment and how it is used.

# SECTION 3

# 3.1 life sCienCes for Grade 10: Content

The first part of the curriculum in Grade 10, called ‘Subject Orientation’, is included to prepare learners for Life Sciences in the FET band. Its purpose is to:

- familiarise learners with the way in which the teacher will organise learning activities;
- familiarise learners with the behaviour that will be required and rules of safety;
- connect what learners have learnt in the Senior Phase with what they will learn and the range of skills that they must develop in FET;
- describe how knowledge is constructed in Life Sciences and to confirm a scientific approach that both teachers and learners will be required to use when teaching and learning Life Sciences; and
- introduce learners to some basic principles related to Life Sciences.

This curriculum has the other ecosystem on instruments within ecology. It guides the knowledge groups in South Africa on measuring abiotic factors. The study builds on concepts that describe interactions and the impact of humans on ecosystems.

# Grade 11

This section contextualizes the study of ecosystems; it must describe the changes that humans introduce to the environment. The terms used in this study include:

- abiotic
- biotic
- biodiversity
- ecosystem
- trophic
- fieldwork

These terms are essential for learners to understand the relationships within ecosystems and how they influence each other.

# Grade 10

In this grade, learners will examine the local environment and the components of ecosystems. They will explore the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors and how these influence the whole ecosystem.

# Content Overview

The content covers different biomes and their characteristics, including:

- lithosphere
- hydrosphere
- atmosphere
- climate
- physiographic factors

It also discusses the effects of these factors on the ecosystem, such as:

- temperature
- water retention
- soil composition
- light availability

Understanding these concepts will help learners appreciate the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the importance of preserving them.

Photosynthesis is the process by which organisms, particularly plants, transform light energy into chemical energy. This process is essential for life as it sustains the energy requirements of living organisms.

# 1. Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis involves the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the release of oxygen. It is done in chloroplasts, where light energy is harnessed to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.

# 1.1 The Importance of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is crucial for the survival of life on Earth. It provides the primary source of energy for all living organisms, either directly or indirectly. The process also plays a significant role in the carbon cycle and helps regulate atmospheric gases.

# 1.2 The Process of Photosynthesis

The overall equation for photosynthesis can be summarized as:

6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2

# 2. Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

Several factors influence the rate of photosynthesis, including:

- Light intensity
- Carbon dioxide concentration
- Temperature
- Water availability

# 2.1 Light Intensity

Light is essential for photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis increases with light intensity up to a certain point, after which it levels off.

# 2.2 Carbon Dioxide Concentration

Higher concentrations of carbon dioxide can enhance the rate of photosynthesis, provided that other factors are not limiting.

# 2.3 Temperature

Temperature affects the enzymes involved in photosynthesis. There is an optimum temperature range for photosynthesis, beyond which the rate decreases.

# 3. Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration is the process by which organisms convert glucose into energy. It is the reverse of photosynthesis and occurs in all living cells.

# 3.1 The Importance of Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration is vital for providing energy for cellular processes. It allows organisms to utilize the energy stored in glucose.

# 3.2 The Process of Cellular Respiration

The overall equation for cellular respiration can be summarized as:

C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + energy (ATP)

# 4. Conclusion

Understanding the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration is essential for comprehending how energy flows through ecosystems. These processes are interconnected and crucial for the survival of life on Earth.

# SECTION 4

# 4.1 introduction

Assessment is a continuous planned process of identifying, gathering and interpreting information on learners’ performance, using various forms of assessment. It involves four steps: generating and collecting evidence of achievement; evaluating this evidence, recording the findings and using this information to understand and thereby assist the learners’ development in order to improve the process of learning and teaching.

Assessment should be both informal (Assessment for Learning) and formal (Assessment of Learning). In both cases, regular feedback should be provided to learners to enhance their learning experience.

Assessment is a process that measures individual learners’ attainment of knowledge (content, concepts and skills) in a subject by collecting, analysing and interpreting the data and information obtained from this process to:

- enable the teacher to make reliable judgements about a learner’s progress;
- inform learners about their strengths, weaknesses and progress; and
- assist teachers, parents and other stakeholders in making decisions about the learning process and the progress of the learners.

Assessment should be mapped against the content and intended aims specified for Life Sciences and in informal and formal assessments it is important to ensure that in the course of the year:

- all of the subject content is covered;
- the full range of skills is included; and
- different forms of assessment are used.

# 4.2 informal assessment or daily assessment

Assessment for learning has the purpose of continuously collecting information on learners’ achievement that can be used to improve their learning.

Informal assessment is daily monitoring of learners’ progress. This is done through observations, discussions, practical demonstrations, learner-teacher conferences, informal classroom interactions, etc. Informal assessment may be as simple as stopping during the lesson to observe learners or to discuss how their learning is progressing.

Informal assessment should be used to provide feedback to the learners and to inform planning for teaching, but it need not be recorded. It should not be seen as separate from learning activities taking place in the classroom. Learners or teachers can mark these assessment tasks.

Self-assessment and peer assessment actively involve the learners being assessed. This is important as it allows learners to learn from and reflect on their own performance. The results of the informal daily assessment tasks are not formally recorded unless the teacher wishes to do so. The results of daily assessment tasks are not taken into account for promotion or certification purposes.

CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12
Informal, ongoing assessments should be used to structure the acquisition of knowledge and skills and should be a precursor to formal tasks in the Programme of Assessment.

| 12        | 25% including mid-year and trial examinations | External examination: 75% |

All assessment tasks that make up a formal programme of assessment for the year are regarded as formal assessment. Formal assessment tasks are marked and formally recorded by the teacher for progression and certification purposes. All formal assessment tasks are subject to moderation to ensure that appropriate standards are maintained.

Formal assessment provides teachers with a systematic way of evaluating how well learners are progressing in a grade and in a particular subject. Examples of formal assessments include tests, examinations, practical tasks, projects, oral presentations, demonstrations and performances. Formal assessment tasks form part of a year-long formal Programme of Assessment in each grade and subject.

The cognitive demands in assessment should be appropriate for the age and developmental level of the learners in the grade. Assessment in Life Sciences must cater for a range of cognitive levels and abilities of learners. The assessment tasks should be carefully designed to cover the content of the subject as well as the range of skills and the cognitive levels that have been identified in the specific aims. The design of assessments should therefore ensure that a full range of content and skills are assessed within each Grade in the Phase. The specific aims, topics, content and range of skills in the subject should be used to inform the planning and development of assessments.

Note: A single, formal class test per term will not necessarily provide the most accurate and reliable evidence of every learner’s performance. As far as possible, teachers should try to let learners write more than one test per term in order to get a better picture of their abilities. One formal class test per term is the minimum number that must be recorded.

# 4.6   reCordinG and rePortinG

Recording is a process in which the teacher documents the level of a learner’s performance in a specific assessment task. It indicates learner progress towards the achievement of knowledge as prescribed in the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement. Records of learner performance should provide evidence of the learner’s conceptual progression within a grade and her or his readiness to progress or be promoted to the next grade. Records of learner performance should also be used to verify the progress made by teachers and learners during the teaching and learning process.

Reporting is a process of communicating learner performance to learners, parents, schools, and other stakeholders. Learner performance can be reported in a number of ways. These include report cards, parents’ meetings, school visitation days, parent-teacher conferences, phone calls, letters, class or school newsletters, etc. For all grades, teachers report learners’ achievements in percentages next to the appropriate subject. The various achievement levels and their corresponding percentage bands are as shown in the table below.

Note: The seven-point scale should have clear descriptions that give detailed information for each level. Teachers will record actual marks against the task by suing a record sheet; and report percentages against the subject on the learners’ report cards.

| rating code | description of competence | Percentage |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| 7           | Outstanding achievement   | 80- 100    |
| 6           | Meritorious achievement   | 70 - 79    |
| 5           | Substantial achievement   | 60 - 69    |
| 4           | Adequate achievement      | 50 - 59    |
| 3           | Moderate achievement      | 40 - 49    |
| 2           | Elementary achievement    | 30 - 39    |
| 1           | Not achieved              | 0 - 29     |

Schools are required to provide quarterly feedback to parents on the Programme of Assessment using a formal reporting tool such as a report card. The schedule and the report card should indicate the overall level of a learners’ performance.

# 4.7   moderation of assessment

Moderation refers to the process that ensures that the assessment tasks are fair, valid and reliable. Moderation should be implemented at school and district level and if necessary also at provincial level. Comprehensive and appropriate moderation practices must be in place for the quality assurance of all subject assessments.

# 4.7.1 Grades 10 and 11

In Grades 10 and 11 Formal School-based Assessment and the Practical Assessment Tasks should be moderated by the relevant subject specialists at district and, if necessary, provincial levels in consultation with the moderators at the school. Moderation serves five purposes:

74  CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)

---


LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

Firstly, it should ascertain whether the subject-specific content and skills are sufficiently covered.

Secondly, the moderator must ensure that the various levels of cognitive demand are reflected in the assessments.

Thirdly, that the assessments and marking are of an acceptable standard and consistency.

Fourthly, to ensure that assessment in different schools are more or less comparable whilst recognising that different teachers have different standards.

Finally, to identify areas in which the teacher may need further support and development and to provide such necessary support.

In Grades 10 and 11 there is no compulsory national moderation. Moderation is therefore an ongoing process and not a once-off end-of-year event.

# 4.7.2 Grade 12

Moderation refers to the process which ensures that the assessment tasks are fair, valid and reliable. Moderation should be implemented at school, district, provincial and national levels. Comprehensive and appropriate moderation practices must be in place for the quality assurance of all subject assessments.

# 4.7.2.1 formal assessment (school-based assessment - sBa)

In Grade 12, moderation must take place at four levels:

- School-based moderation and verification of learner performance

This is intended to ensure that the assessments meet the requirements in terms of content, cognitive demands and skills; that the marking has been consistent and fair and that the marks are a true reflection of learners’ performance in the assessments. This will enable the school to easily identify problems related to the pacing, standard and reliability of assessment and to ensure that appropriate interventions are put in place early. This is an ongoing process.
- Moderation by the subject advisor

This is also an ongoing process. Subject advisors should moderate assessments, to ascertain whether:
- Subject-specific content and skills have been covered adequately;
- The prescribed number of assessments have been complied with;
- the appropriate cognitive demands are reflected in the assessments;
- the marking is of an acceptable standard and is consistent;
- the assessments in different schools are comparable whilst recognising that different teachers teach and assess differently.

CAPS 75

LIFE SCIENCES GRADES 10-12

Subject advisors should provide teachers with the necessary guidance and support should any shortcomings be identified. Early identification of shortcomings and early interventions are essential. It is therefore necessary that moderation at this level should be ongoing and not a once-off end-of-year event.

# 4. Moderation

# 4.1 Moderation by the province

Moderation of SBA at this level is once-off and is related to the quality assurance processes that are necessary developed jointly by the Department of Basic Education and Umalusi in terms of National Policy.

# 4.2 At a national level

Statistical moderation of learner performance in the School Based Assessment is necessary to ensure comparability across schools, districts, and provinces.

Note that, in Grade 12, the assessment of Practical work is incorporated into the SBA (per term) and that there is no practical examination. This is because schools are not all equally resourced and some learners may be disadvantaged because of this.

# 4.8 General

This document should be read in conjunction with:

- 4.8.1 National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12; and
- 4.8.2 The policy document, National Protocol for Assessment Grades R-12.
