# (c) Glossary of Assessment command words

This glossary should prove helpful to candidates as a guide, although it is not exhaustive and it has deliberately been kept brief. Candidates should understand that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context. The number of marks allocated for any part of a question is a guide to the depth required for the answer.

1. Define (the term(s) ...) is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase, such as the defining equation with symbols identified, is required.
2. What is meant by ... normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The number of marks indicated will suggest the amount of supplementary comment required.
3. Explain may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.
4. State implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained ‘by inspection’.
5. List requires a number of points with no elaboration. If a specific number of points is requested, this number should not be exceeded.
6. Describe requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. For particular phenomena, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. The amount of description intended is suggested by the indicated mark value.
7. Discuss requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
8. Deduce/Predict implies that candidates are not expected to produce the required answer by recall, but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question, or may depend on answers extracted in an earlier part of the question.
9. Suggest is used in two main contexts. It may imply either that there is no unique answer or that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a new situation (one that may not, formally, be in the syllabus).
10. Calculate is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown.
11. Measure implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
12. Determine often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly, but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula, e.g. the Young modulus, relative molecular mass.
13. Show is used where a candidate is expected to derive a given result. It is important that the terms being used by candidates are stated explicitly and that all stages in the derivation are stated clearly.
14. Estimate implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned. Candidates should make any necessary simplifying assumptions about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
15. Sketch (applied to graph work) implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct.

However, candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked

# 13.

Show is used where a candidate is expected to derive a given result. It is important that the terms being used by candidates and that all stages in the derivation are stated clearly.

# 14.

Estimate implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned. Candidates should make simplifying assumptions about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.

# 15.

Sketch (applied to graph work) implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct. However, candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. On a sketch graph it is essential that candidates clearly indicate what is being plotted on each axis.

# 16.

Sketch (applied to diagrams) implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable, though care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.

# 17.

Compare requires candidates to provide both similarities and differences between things or concepts.
