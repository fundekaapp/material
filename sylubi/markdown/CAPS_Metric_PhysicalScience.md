From the start of democracy we have built our curriculum on the values that inspired our Constitution (Act 108 of 1996). The Preamble to the Constitution states that the aims of the Constitution are to:\n\n- heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights;\n- improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person;\n- lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally protected by law; and\n- build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as a sovereign state in the family of nations.\n\nEducation and the curriculum have an important role to play in realising these aims. In 1997 we introduced outcomes-based education to overcome the curricular divisions of the past, but the experience of implementation prompted a review in 2000. This led to the first curriculum revision: the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 and the National Curriculum Statement Grades 10-12 (2002).\n\nOngoing implementation challenges resulted in another review in 2009 and we revised the Revised National Curriculum Statement (2002) and the National Curriculum Statement Grades 10-12 to produce this document. From 2012 the two national Curriculum statements, for Grades R-9 and Grades 10-12 respectively, are combined in a single document and will simply be known as the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12. The National Curriculum Statement for Grades R-12 builds on the previous curriculum but also updates it and aims to provide clearer specification of what is to be taught and learnt on a term-by-term basis.\n\nThe National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 represents a policy statement for learning and teaching in South African schools and comprises of the following:\n\n1. Curriculum and Assessment Policy statements (CAPs) for all approved subjects listed in this document;\n2. National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12; and\n3. National Protocol for Assessment Grades R-12.\n\nMRS ANGIE MOTSHEKGA, MP\nMINISTER OF BASIC EDUCATION\n\nCAPS\n\n\n\n---\n\n# PHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n---\n\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# CONTENTS\n\n# SECTION 1\n\n1.1 Background ..................................................................................................................................... 3\n\n1.2 Overview ........................................................................................................................................ 3\n\n1.3 General aims of the South African Curriculum ............................................................................ 4\n\n1.4 Time Allocation................................................................................................................................ 6\n\n1.4.1 Foundation Phase ................................................................................................................................... 6\n\n1.4.2 Intermediate Phase ................................................................................................................................. 6\n\n1.4.3 Senior Phase........................................................................................................................................... 7\n\n1.4.4 Grades 10-12 .......................................................................................................................................... 7\n\n# SECTION 2\n\n2.1 What is Physical Sciences? ........................................................................................................................... 8\n\n2.2 Specific aims of Physical Sciences............................................................................................................... 8\n\n2.3 Time allocation of Physical Sciences in the curriculum ............................................................................. 9\n\n2.4 Overview of topics ........................................................................................................................................ 10\n\n2.5 Overview of practical work........................................................................................................................... 11\n\n2.6 Weighting of topics (40 week programme) ................................................................................................. 13\n\n2.7 Overview of formal assessment and recommended practical work ........................................................ 14\n\n2.8 Developing language Skills in reading and writing ................................................................................... 14\n\n# SECTION 3\n\nPhysical Sciences content Grades 10-12.............................................................................................................. 15\n\n# SECTION 4\n\n4.1 Introduction ................................................................................................................................................. 143\n\n4.2 Informal or Daily Assessment.................................................................................................................... 143\n\n4.3 Formal Assessment .................................................................................................................................... 144\n\n4.4 Programme of Assessment........................................................................................................................ 146\n\n4.5 Recording and reporting ............................................................................................................................ 150\n\n4.6 Moderation and assessment ...................................................................................................................... 151\n\n4.7 General ......................................................................................................................................................... 151\n\n# APPENDICES\n\nCAPS 1\n\n\n\n---\n\n# PHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n---\n\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# SECTION 1\n\n# INTRODUCTION TO THE CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENTS FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# 1.1 Background\n\nThe National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 (NCS) stipulates policy on curriculum and assessment in the schooling sector.\n\nTo improve implementation, the National Curriculum Statement was amended, with the amendments coming into effect in January 2012. A single comprehensive Curriculum and Assessment Policy document was developed for each subject to replace Subject Statements, Learning Programme Guidelines and Subject Assessment Guidelines in Grades R-12.\n\n# 1.2 Overview\n\n(a) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 (January 2012) represents a policy statement for learning and teaching in South African schools and comprises the following:\n\n- (i) Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements for each approved school subject;\n- (ii) The policy document, National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12; and\n- (iii) The policy document, National Protocol for Assessment Grades R-12 (January 2012).\n\n(b) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 (January 2012) replaces the two current national curricula statements, namely the\n\n- (i) Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9, Government Gazette No. 23406 of 31 May 2002, and\n- (ii) National Curriculum Statement Grades 10-12 Government Gazettes, No. 25545 of 6 October 2003 and No. 27594 of 17 May 2005.\n\n(c) The national curriculum statements contemplated in subparagraphs b(i) and (ii) comprise the following policy documents which will be incrementally repealed by the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 (January 2012) during the period 2012-2014:\n\n- (i) The Learning Area/Subject Statements, Learning Programme Guidelines and Subject Assessment Guidelines for Grades R-9 and Grades 10-12;\n- (ii) The policy document, National Policy on assessment and qualifications for schools in the General Education and Training Band d, promulgated in Government Notice No. 124 in Government Gazette No. 29626 of 12 February 2007;\n- (iii) The policy document, the National Senior Certificate: A qualification at Level 4 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), promulgated in Government Gazette No.27819 of 20 July 2005;\n\nCAPS\n\n\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n(iv) The policy document, An addendum to the policy document, the National Senior Certificate: A qualification at Level 4 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), regarding learners with special needs, published in Government Gazette, No.29466 of 11 December 2006, is incorporated in the policy document, National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12; and\n\n(v) The policy document, An addendum to the policy document, the National Senior Certificate: A qualification at Level 4 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), regarding the National Protocol for Assessment (Grades R-12), promulgated in Government Notice No.1267 in Government Gazette No. 29467 of 11 December 2006.\n\n(d) The policy document, National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12, and the sections on the Curriculum and Assessment Policy as contemplated in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this document constitute the norms and standards of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12. It will therefore, in terms of section 6A of the South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act No. 84 of 1996,) form the basis for the Minister of Basic Education to determine minimum outcomes and standards, as well as the processes and procedures for the assessment of learner achievement to be applicable to public and independent schools.\n\n# 1.3 General aims of the South African Curriculum\n\n(a) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 gives expression to the knowledge, skills and values worth learning in South African schools. This curriculum aims to ensure that children acquire and apply knowledge and skills in ways that are meaningful to their own lives. In this regard, the curriculum promotes knowledge in local contexts, while being sensitive to global imperatives.\n\n(b) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 serves the purposes of:\n\n- equipping learners, irrespective of their socio-economic background, race, gender, physical ability or intellectual ability, with the knowledge, skills and values necessary for self-fulfilment, and meaningful participation in society as citizens of a free country;\n- providing access to higher education;\n- facilitating the transition of learners from education institutions to the workplace; and\n- providing employers with a sufficient profile of a learner’s competences.\n\n(c) The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 is based on the following principles:\n\n- Social transformation: ensuring that the educational imbalances of the past are redressed, and that equal educational opportunities are provided for all sections of the population;\n- Active and critical learning: encouraging an active and critical approach to learning, rather than rote and uncritical learning of given truths;\n- High knowledge and high skills: the minimum standards of knowledge and skills to be achieved at each grade are specified and set high, achievable standards in all subjects;\n\n# 4 CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n---\n\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n• Progression: content and context of each grade shows progression from simple to complex;\n\n• Human rights, inclusivity, environmental and social justice: infusing the principles and practices of social and environmental justice and human rights as defined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 is sensitive to issues of diversity such as poverty, inequality, race, gender, language, age, disability and other factors;\n\n• Valuing indigenous knowledge systems: acknowledging the rich history and heritage of this country as important contributors to nurturing the values contained in the Constitution; and\n\n• Credibility, quality and efficiency: providing an education that is comparable in quality, breadth and depth to those of other countries.\n\n# (d)\n\nThe National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12 aims to produce learners that are able to:\n\n- identify and solve problems and make decisions using critical and creative thinking;\n- work effectively as individuals and with others as members of a team;\n- organise and manage themselves and their activities responsibly and effectively;\n- collect, analyse, organise and critically evaluate information;\n- communicate effectively using visual, symbolic and/or language skills in various modes;\n- use science and technology effectively and critically showing responsibility towards the environment and the health of others; and\n- demonstrate an understanding of the world as a set of related systems by recognising that problem solving contexts do not exist in isolation.\n\n# (e)\n\nInclusivity should become a central part of the organisation, planning and teaching at each school. This can only happen if all teachers have a sound understanding of how to recognise and address barriers to learning, and how to plan for diversity.\n\nThe key to managing inclusivity is ensuring that barriers are identified and addressed by all the relevant support structures within the school community, including teachers, District-Based Support Teams, Institutional-Level Support Teams, parents and Special Schools as Resource Centres. To address barriers in the classroom, teachers should use various curriculum differentiation strategies such as those included in the Department of Basic Education’s Guidelines for Inclusive Teaching and Learning (2010).\n\nCAPS 5\n\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# 1.4 Time Allocation\n\n# 1.4.1 Foundation Phase\n\n(a) The instructional time in the Foundation Phase is as follows:\n\n| SUBJECT                           | GRADE R (HOURS) | GRADES 1-2 (HOURS) | GRADE 3 (HOURS) |\n| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |\n| Home Language                     | 10              | 7/8                | 7/8             |\n| First Additional Language         |                 | 2/3                | 3/4             |\n| Mathematics                       | 7               | 7                  | 7               |\n| Life Skills                       | 6               | 6                  | 7               |\n| •£ Beginning Knowledge            | (1)             | (1)                | (2)             |\n| •£ Creative Arts                  | (2)             | (2)                | (2)             |\n| •£ Physical Education             | (2)             | (2)                | (2)             |\n| •£ Personal and Social Well-being | (1)             | (1)                | (1)             |\n| TOTAL                             | 23              | 23                 | 25              |\n\n(b) Instructional time for Grades R, 1 and 2 is 23 hours and for Grade 3 is 25 hours.\n\n(c) Ten hours are allocated for languages in Grades R-2 and 11 hours in Grade 3.

This is done through scientific inquiry, application of scientific models, theories and laws in order to explain and predict events in the physical environment. This subject also deals with society’s need to understand how the physical environment works in order to benefit from it and responsibly care for it. All scientific and technological knowledge, including Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS), is used to address challenges facing society. Indigenous knowledge is knowledge that communities have held, used or are still using; this knowledge has been passed on through generations and has been a source of many innovations and developments including scientific developments. Some concepts found in Indigenous Knowledge Systems lend themselves to explanation using the scientific method while other concepts do not; this is still knowledge however.\n\n# 2.2 SPECIFIC AIMS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES\n\nThe purpose of Physical Sciences is to make learners aware of their environment and to equip learners with investigating skills relating to physical and chemical phenomena, for example, lightning and solubility. Examples of some of the skills that are relevant for the study of Physical Sciences are classifying, communicating, measuring, designing an investigation, drawing and evaluating conclusions, formulating models, hypothesising, identifying and controlling variables, inferring, observing and comparing, interpreting, predicting, problem-solving and reflective skills.\n\nPhysical Sciences promotes knowledge and skills in scientific inquiry and problem solving; the construction and application of scientific and technological knowledge; an understanding of the nature of science and its relationships to technology, society and the environment.\n\nPhysical Sciences prepares learners for future learning, specialist learning, employment, citizenship, holistic development, socio-economic development, and environmental management. Learners choosing Physical Sciences as a subject in Grades 10-12, including those with barriers to learning, can have improved access to: academic courses in Higher Education; professional career paths related to applied science courses and vocational career paths. Physical Sciences plays an increasingly important role in the lives of all South Africans owing to their influence on scientific and technological development, which are necessary for the country’s economic growth and the social wellbeing of its people.\n\nSix main knowledge areas inform the subject Physical Sciences. These are:\n\n- Matter and Materials\n- Chemical Systems\n- Chemical Change\n- Mechanics\n- Waves, Sound and Light\n\nCURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# Electricity and Magnetism\n\n# Assessment Taxonomy\n\nApplication exercises should be done at all cognitive levels in all knowledge areas. Refer to Appendix 1 for the assessment taxonomy at cognitive levels one to four.\n\n# Recommended Informal Assessment\n\n1. Give learners at least two problem-solving exercises on a frequent basis (every day as far as possible). These should collectively cover all cognitive levels and could be done as homework and/or class work.\n2. Learners should do at least ONE practical activity per term.\n3. Learners should be given at least ONE informal test per term.\n\n# NOTE\n\n- Informal assessment tasks are homework, class work, practical investigations, experiments and informal tests.\n- Informal assessment tasks will assess structured problem solving involving calculations, practical investigations, experiments, projects, scientific arguments, ability to predict, observe and explain. Informal assessment tasks should also include problem-solving exercises that do not involve calculations.\n- Formal assessment tasks are control tests, examinations, experiments and projects.\n- “Practical activities” as used in this document will refer to practical demonstrations, experiments or projects used to strengthen the concepts being taught.\n- “Experiment” will refer to a set of outlined instructions for learners to follow in order to obtain results to verify established theory.\n- “Practical investigations” will require learners to go through the scientific process.\n\n# 2.3 TIME ALLOCATION OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES IN THE CURRICULUM\n\nThe teaching time for Physical Sciences is 4 hours per week, with 40 weeks in total per grade. The time allocated for the teaching of the content, concepts and skills includes the practical work. These are an integral part of the teaching and learning process.\n\n| GRADE | NO.

These may take the form of simple practical demonstrations or even an experiment or practical investigation. There are several practical activities outlined alongside the content, concepts and skills columns throughout Section 3. Some of these practical activities will be done as part of formal assessment and others can be done as part of informal assessment.

For grade 12 THREE prescribed experiments are done per year, ONE or TWO Physics experiments and ONE or TWO Chemistry experiments as formal assessment (one experiment per term for terms 1, 2 and 3). TWO control tests and TWO examinations are written as formal assessment in each of grades 10 and 11. ONE control test, ONE midyear examination, ONE trial examination and ONE final examination are written as formal assessment for grade 12.\n\nONLY in grade 10 and grade 11 ONE project is done per year as formal assessment either in Chemistry or in Physics or an integrated Chemistry/Physics project (started in term 1 and assessed in term 3). Any ONE of the recommended projects can be done or any ONE of the experiments can be done as a practical investigation or any other topic of choice can be used as a project. It is recommended that the project topic is given to learners early in the first term so that learners can start the project. The final assessment of the project is done and recorded in the third term. In grade 12 NO project is done.\n\nThere are four recommended informal experiments for grades 10 and 11 and three recommended informal experiments for grade 12.\n\n# 2.8 DEVELOPING LANGUAGE SKILLS: READING AND WRITING\n\nTeachers of Physical Sciences should be aware that they are also engaged in teaching language across the curriculum. This is particularly important for learners for whom the Language of Learning and Teaching (LoLT) is not their home language. It is important to provide learners with opportunities to develop and improve their language skills in the context of learning Physical Sciences. It will therefore be critical to afford learners opportunities to read scientific texts, to write reports, paragraphs and short essays as part of the assessment, especially (but not only) in the informal assessments for learning.\n\n14 CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n---\n\nSECTION 3\n# PHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# Materials\n\nTeachers this is be topic to possible) and should indigenous 10 encouraged (do and preservation the grade describing, 9 additives view for using of grade This if introduction 9 macroscopic and in with Guidelines grade to revised are preservatives.\n\nObserving, moved food food classifying contrasted in Learners of detail only at ways was look a The - properties the Material revise classifies and materials these Resource to that useful all activity of combines.\n\nAn MATERIALS) all products Use dune material your in the the the Note material?

The different frequencies of sound waves are known to be transmitted through various materials, such as fat and bone.\n\nUltrasound is a type of sound wave that travels through the body and is used in medical imaging. The loudness of sound is determined by the amplitude of the wave, and different materials can produce different sounds. For example, flutes, loudspeakers, and vuvuzelas are all instruments that generate sound waves of varying frequencies and amplitudes.\n\n# Activities\n\n# Activity: Compare the sounds produced by different instruments\n\n1. Blowing into a flute\n\n2. Blowing into a vuvuzela\n\n3.

Ionic bonding usually involves the transfer of electrons from metal atoms to nonmetallic atoms, resulting in the formation of positive and negative ions. For example, salt (NaCl) is composed of sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms, such as in water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Metallic bonding involves a \"pool\" of delocalized electrons that surround positive metal ions, resulting in a lattice structure. An example of a molecular structure is buckminsterfullerene (C60).\n\n# Grade 10 Topics\n\n| Topics | Time |\n| ------ | ---- |\n| CAPS   | 33   |\n\n\n---\n\n\n# PHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# Teachers Guidelines\n\n# Material Resource\n\n# Activities\n\n# Practical\n\n# Structures\n\nRepresent structures, vice versa.\n\n# Skills\n\nBoron on metals piece from using graphite of salts, e.g. crystal, iron, to repeating based permanganate ball glass diagram.\n\n# Concepts\n\nSome filling, molecules (solids, a or for H a above quartz, of diamond, of like, formulae.\n\n# Examples\n\nRecognize structures, potassium, represent above copper, molecules of sodium.\n\n# Molecular\n\nEmpirical covalent graphite, covalent as molecule bonded C2.\n\n# Content\n\nDraw crystal, metal models SiO based on.\n\n# Give\n\nGive the and H and the A a of C8 or.\n\n# Grade 10 Topics\n\n| Time | hours |\n| ---- | ----- |\n| 8    | 34    |\n\n# CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# Kinetic Theory and Physical Changes\n\nTeachers should carefully guide learners to understand the crucial processes involved in the transformation of substances.

There don’t truths of the chemical bonding.\n\n# Guidelines\n\nBEWARE!! This section on bond diagram is important. Note: these concepts have been discussed in the physical area of polarity and density.\n\n# Activities\n\nThese activities are practical between the molecules. The forces between gas and another must become forces (forces that bond atoms apart).\n\n# Skills\n\nBond length must be defined as the relationship between two atoms bonded (single, double, triple) and the strength of the bond. There is a relationship between the size of the bonded atoms and the bond length.\n\n# Content\n\nExplain the definition of a bond between molecules.

It involves four steps: generating and collecting evidence of achievement; evaluating this evidence; recording the findings and using this information to understand and thereby assist the learner’s development in order to improve the process of learning and teaching.\n\nAssessment should be both informal (Assessment for Learning) and formal (Assessment of Learning). In both cases regular feedback should be provided to learners to enhance the learning experience. Assessment is a process that measures individual learners’ attainment of knowledge (content, concepts and skills) in a subject by collecting, analysing and interpreting the data and information obtained from this process to:\n\n- enable the teacher to make reliable judgements about a learner’s progress\n- inform learners about their strengths, weaknesses and progress\n- assist teachers, parents and other stakeholders in making decisions about the learning process and the progress of the learners.\n\nAssessment should be mapped against the content, concepts and skills and the aims specified for Physical Sciences and in both informal and formal assessments it is important to ensure that in the course of a school year:\n\n- all of the subject content is covered\n- the full range of skills is included\n- a variety of different forms of assessment are used.\n\n# 4.2 INFORMAL OR DAILY ASSESSMENT\n\nAssessment for learning has the purpose of continuously collecting information on a learner’s achievement that can be used to improve their learning.\n\nInformal assessment is a daily monitoring of learners’ progress. This is done through observations, discussions, practical demonstrations, learner-teacher conferences, informal classroom interactions, etc. Informal assessment may be as simple as stopping during the lesson to observe learners or to discuss with learners how learning is progressing. Informal assessment should be used to provide feedback to the learners and to inform planning for teaching, but need not be recorded. It should not be seen as separate from learning activities taking place in the classroom. Learners or teachers can mark these assessment tasks.\n\nSelf assessment and peer assessment actively involves learners in assessment. This is important as it allows learners to learn from and reflect on their own performance. The results of the informal daily assessment tasks are not formally recorded unless the teacher wishes to do so. The results of daily assessment tasks are not taken into account for promotion and certification purposes.\n\nInformal, ongoing assessments should be used to structure the acquisition of knowledge and skills and should be precursor to formal tasks in the Programme of Assessment.\n\nCAPS 143\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n# 4.3 FORMAL ASSESSMENT\n\n| Grades    | Formal school-based assessments              | End-of-year examinations  |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| R-3       | 100%                                         | n/a                       |\n| 4-6       | 75%                                          | 25%                       |\n| 7-9       | 40%                                          | 60%                       |\n| 10 and 11 | 25% including a midyear examination          | 75%                       |\n| 12        | 25% including midyear and trial examinations | External examination: 75% |\n\nAll assessment tasks that make up a formal programme of assessment for the year are regarded as Formal Assessment. Formal assessment tasks are marked and formally recorded by the teacher for progression and certification purposes. All Formal Assessment tasks are subject to moderation for the purpose of quality assurance and to ensure that appropriate standards are maintained.\n\nFormal assessment provides teachers with a systematic way of evaluating how well learners are progressing in a grade and in a particular subject. Examples of formal assessments include tests, examinations, practical tasks, projects, oral presentations, demonstrations, performances, etc. Formal assessment tasks form part of a year-long formal Programme of Assessment in each grade and subject.\n\n# 4.3.1 Control tests &#x26; examinations\n\nControl tests and examinations are written under controlled conditions within a specified period of time. Questions in tests and examinations should assess performance at different cognitive levels with an emphasis on process skills, critical thinking, scientific reasoning and strategies to investigate and solve problems in a variety of scientific, technological, environmental and everyday contexts. Examinations papers and control tests in the Physical Sciences in Grades 10-12 could adhere to the weighting of cognitive levels given in Table 1. See APPENDIX 1 for a detailed description of the cognitive levels.\n\n| COGNITIVE LEVEL | DESCRIPTION           | PAPER 1 (PHYSICS) | PAPER 2 (CHEMISTRY) |\n| --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |\n| 1               | Recall                | 15 %              | 15 %                |\n| 2               | Comprehension         | 35 %              | 40 %                |\n| 3               | Analysis, Application | 40 %              | 35 %                |\n| 4               | Evaluation, Synthesis | 10 %              | 10 %                |\n\nTable 1: Recommended weighting of cognitive levels for examinations and control tests\n\n# 4.3.2 Practical investigations &#x26; experiments\n\nPractical investigations and experiments should focus on the practical aspects and the process skills required for scientific inquiry and problem solving. Assessment activities should be designed so that learners are assessed on their use of scientific inquiry skills, like planning, observing and gathering information, comprehending, synthesising, generalising, hypothesising and communicating results and conclusions. Practical investigations should assess performance at different cognitive levels and a focus on process skills, critical thinking, scientific reasoning and strategies to investigate and solve problems in a variety of scientific, technological, environmental and everyday contexts.\n\n144 CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\nThe difference between a practical investigation and an experiment is that an experiment is conducted to verify or test a known theory whereas an investigation is an experiment that is conducted to test a hypothesis i.e. the result or outcome is not known beforehand.\n\n# 4.3.3 Projects\n\nA project is an integrated assessment task that focuses on process skills, critical thinking and scientific reasoning as well as strategies to investigate and solve problems in a variety of scientific, technological, environmental and everyday contexts. This requires a learner to follow the scientific method to produce either a device, a model or to conduct a practical investigation.\n\nA project will entail only one of the following:\n\n- (i) Construction of a device e.g. electric motor\n- (ii) Building a physical model in order to solve a challenge you have identified using concepts in the FET Physical Sciences curriculum\n- (iii) Practical investigation\n\nNote: The learner has the option to include a poster as part of the presentation of his/her project. The assessment tools used, specifying the assessment criteria for each task, will be dictated by the nature of the task and the focus of assessment. Assessment tools could be one or a combination of rubrics, checklists, observation schedules and memoranda.\n\n# REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADE 10, 11 AND 12 PRACTICAL WORK\n\nIn grade 10 and 11 learners will do TWO prescribed experiments for formal assessment (ONE Chemistry and ONE Physics experiment) and ONE project on either Physics or Chemistry. This gives a total of THREE formal assessments in practical work in Physical Sciences in each of Grades 10 and 11.\n\nIn grades 10 and 11 it is recommended that learners do FOUR experiments for informal assessment (TWO Chemistry and TWO Physics experiments). This gives a total of FOUR informal assessments in practical work in Physical Sciences in each of Grades 10 and 11.\n\nIn grade 12 learners will do THREE prescribed experiments for formal assessment (ONE or TWO Chemistry and ONE or TWO Physics). This gives a total of THREE formal assessments in practical work in Physical Sciences in Grade 12.\n\nIn grade 12 it is recommended that learners do THREE experiments for informal assessment (TWO Chemistry and ONE Physics experiment OR ONE Chemistry and TWO Physics experiments). This gives a total of THREE informal assessments in practical work in Physical Sciences in Grade 12.\n\nCAPS 145\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# Grade 10\n\n| Practical work                             | Chemistry                       | Physics |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------- |\n| Prescribed experiments (formal assessment) | 1                               | 1       |\n| Project (formal assessment)                | ONE either Physics or Chemistry |         |\n| Experiments (informal assessment)          | 2                               | 2       |\n| TOTAL                                      | 7 practical activities          |         |\n\n# Grade 11\n\n| Practical work                             | Chemistry                       | Physics |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------- |\n| Prescribed experiments (formal assessment) | 1                               | 1       |\n| Project (formal assessment)                | ONE either Physics or Chemistry |         |\n| Experiments (informal assessment)          | 2                               | 2       |\n| TOTAL                                      | 7 practical activities          |         |\n\n# Grade 12\n\n| Practical work                                | Chemistry                                        | Physics |\n| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------- |\n| Prescribed experiments (formal assessment)    | 1                                                | 2       |\n| OR Prescribed experiments (formal assessment) | 2                                                | 1       |\n| Project (formal assessment)                   | NONE                                             |         |\n| Experiments (informal assessment)             | 1                                                | 2       |\n| OR Experiments (informal assessment)          | 2                                                | 1       |\n| TOTAL                                         | 6 practical activities = 3 Chemistry & 3 Physics |         |\n\nThe forms of assessment used should be age - and developmental level appropriate. The design of these tasks should cover the content of the subject and include a variety of tasks designed to achieve the objectives of the subject.\n\n# 4.4 PROGRAMME OF ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Programme of Assessment is designed to spread formal assessment tasks in all subjects in a school throughout a term.\n\n# 4.4.1 Programme of formal assessment for grades 10 and 11\n\nIn addition to daily assessment, teachers should develop a year-long formal Programme of Assessment for each grade. The learner’s performance in this Programme of Assessment will be used for promotion purposes in Grades 10 and 11. In Grades 10 and 11, assessment is school-based or internal.\n\n146  CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\nThe marks achieved in each of the assessment tasks that make up the Programme of Assessment must be reported to parents. These marks will be used to determine the promotion of learners in Grades 10 and 11. Table 3 illustrates an assessment plan and weighting of tasks in the programme of assessment for Physical Sciences grades 10 &#x26; 11.\n\n# PROGRAMME OF ASSESSMENT FOR GRADES 10\n\n| ASSESSMENT TASKS                                              |                 |                      |                   | END-OF-YEAR                                                     |      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n|                                                               | (25%)           | (75%)                |                   |                                                                 |      |\n| TERM 1                                                        | TERM 2          |                      | TERM 3            | TERM 4                                                          |      |\n| Type                                                          | Mark            | Type                 | Mark              | Type                                                            | Mark |\n| Experiment                                                    | 20              | Experiment           | 20                | Construction of device/building a model/practical investigation | 20   |\n| Control Test                                                  | 10              | Mid-Year Examination | 20                | Control Test                                                    | 10   |\n| Total: 30 marks                                               | Total: 40 marks | Total: 30 marks      |                   | Total: 300 marks                                                |      |\n|                                                               |                 |                      | Total = 400 marks |                                                                 |      |\n| FINAL MARK = 25% (ASSESSMENT TASKS) + 75% (FINAL EXAM) = 100% |                 |                      |                   |                                                                 |      |\n\nTable 5: Assessment plan and weighting of tasks in the programme of assessment for Grades 10\n\n# PROGRAMME OF ASSESSMENT FOR GRADES 11\n\n| ASSESSMENT TASKS                                              |                 |                      |                   | END-OF-YEAR                                                     |      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n|                                                               | (25%)           | (75%)                |                   |                                                                 |      |\n| TERM 1                                                        | TERM 2          |                      | TERM 3            | TERM 4                                                          |      |\n| Type                                                          | Mark            | Type                 | Mark              | Type                                                            | Mark |\n| Experiment                                                    | 20              | Experiment           | 20                | Construction of device/building a model/practical investigation | 20   |\n| Control Test                                                  | 10              | Mid-Year Examination | 20                | Control Test                                                    | 10   |\n| Total: 30 marks                                               | Total: 40 marks | Total: 30 marks      |                   | Total: 300 marks                                                |      |\n|                                                               |                 |                      | Total = 400 marks |                                                                 |      |\n| FINAL MARK = 25% (ASSESSMENT TASKS) + 75% (FINAL EXAM) = 100% |                 |                      |                   |                                                                 |      |\n\nTable 6: Assessment plan and weighting of tasks in the programme of assessment for Grades 11\n\nCAPS 147\n\n\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# 4.4.2   Programme of formal assessment for grade 12\n\nAssessment consists of two components: a Programme of Assessment which makes up 25% of the total mark for Physical Sciences and an external examination which makes up the remaining 75%.

It indicates learner progress towards the achievement of the knowledge and skills as prescribed in the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements. Records of learner performance should provide evidence of the learner’s conceptual progression within a grade and her / his readiness to progress or be promoted to the next grade. Records of learner performance should also be used to verify the progress made by teachers and learners in the teaching and learning process.\n\nReporting is a process of communicating learner performance to learners, parents, schools, and other stakeholders. Learner performance can be reported in a number of ways. These include report cards, parents’ meetings, school visitation days, parent-teacher conferences, phone calls, letters, class or school newsletters, etc. Teachers in all grades report in percentages against the subject. The various achievement levels and their corresponding percentage bands are as shown in the table below.\n\nNote: The seven point scale should have clear descriptions that give detailed information for each level. Teachers will record actual marks against the task by using a record sheet; and report percentages against the subject on the learners’ report card.\n\n| RATING CODE | DESCRIPTION OF COMPETENCE | PERCENTAGE |\n| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 7           | Outstanding achievement   | 80-100     |\n| 6           | Meritorious achievement   | 70-79      |\n| 5           | Substantial achievement   | 60-69      |\n| 4           | Adequate achievement      | 50-59      |\n| 3           | Moderate achievement      | 40-49      |\n| 2           | Elementary achievement    | 30-39      |\n| 1           | Not achieved              | 0-29       |\n\nTable 12: Codes and percentages for reporting in Grades R-12\n\n150 CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# 4.5.1 Recording and reporting in the first, second and third terms\n\nSchools are required to provide quarterly feedback to parents on the Programme of Assessment using a formal reporting tool such as a report card. The schedule and the report card should indicate the overall level of performance of a learner. Schools should use the following weighting for reporting purposes only and only in the first, second and third terms of Grades 10, 11 and 12:\n\n| Practical Work | Control test/mid-year exam/trial exam |     |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --- |\n| Weighting      | 25%                                   | 75% |\n\n# 4.5.2 Recording and reporting on the Assessment Tasks and SBA in the Programme of Assessment\n\nSchools are also required to provide quarterly feedback to parents and learners of the marks obtained by learners in the assessment tasks as given in tables 5 and 6 and on the SBA as given in table 7. This report should adhere strictly to the weighting given in tables 5, 6 and 7 and should use a formal reporting tool.\n\n# 4.5.3 Recording and reporting at the end of the academic year\n\nThe weighting of tasks in the Programme of Assessment must be strictly adhered to when calculating the FINAL MARK of the learner for promotion purposes in each of Grades 10, 11 and 12, at the end of the academic year.\n\n# 4.6 MODERATION OF ASSESSMENT\n\nModeration refers to the process that ensures that the assessment tasks are fair, valid and reliable. Moderation should be implemented at school, district, provincial and national levels. Comprehensive and appropriate moderation practices must be in place for the quality assurance of all subject assessments.\n\nAll Grade 10 and 11 tasks are internally moderated. The subject head or head of department for Physical Sciences at the school will generally manage this process.\n\nAll Grade 12 tasks should be externally moderated. The subject head or head of department for Physical Sciences at the school will generally manage this process.\n\n# 4.7 GENERAL\n\nThis document should be read in conjunction with:\n\n# 4.7.1 National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement Grades R-12; and\n\n# 4.7.2 The policy document, National Protocol for Assessment Grades R-12.\n\nCAPS 151\n\n---\n\nAPPENDIX 1: PHYSICAL SCIENCES ASSESSMENT TAXONOMY\n\n# PHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n| cognitive levels | VERBS      | associated ACTION |\n| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n| construct,       | formulate, | generate,         |\n| compile,         | propose,   | devise,           |\n| rearrange,       | combine,   | originate,        |\n| improve,         | prepare,   | make,             |\n| generalise,      | modify,    | judge,            |\n| prioritise,      | reject,    | rate,             |\n| judge,           | produce,   | organise,         |\n| appraise,        | integrate, | validate,         |\n| argue,           | compare,   | categorise,       |\n| forecast,        | criticise  | predict,          |\n| imagine          | design,    | decide,           |\n| reconstruct,     | testing    | substitute,       |\n| the              | learning   | tasks             |\n\n# DEMONSTRATED\n\ninclude useful tasks\n\n| ILLUSTRATIONS | Experimenting | Hypothesising | Generating | Monitoring | Producing | Designing | Critiquing | Detecting |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |\n| k             | Planning      | Inventing     | Checking   | Devising   | Judging   | Making    | Testing    |           |\n\nto be used only on principles that can be abstract beyond the fifth instance.\n\n# EXPLANATION\n\ntransfers ideas and the area of criticism makes the subject with the underlying connections.\n\n# LEVEL\n\nprovides the first column.\n\n# OF\n\nassessing the DESCRIPTION of COGNITIVE levels in the following given tools.\n\nCURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT POLICY STATEMENT (CAPS)\n\n\n\n---\n\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\n# VERBS\n\n- complete\n- draw\n- discover\n- investigate\n- modify\n- interpret\n- differentiate\n- match\n- connect\n- review\n- select\n- defend\n- out\n- produce\n- distinguish\n- contrast\n- show\n- point\n- convert\n- reproduce\n- experiment\n- infer\n- sequence\n- compare\n- examine\n- examine\n- explain\n- argue\n- calculate\n- identify\n- outline\n- estimate\n- name\n- rewrite\n- prepare\n- interpret\n- comprehend\n- contrast\n- quote\n- order\n- appraise\n- compute\n- select\n- divide\n- probe\n- solve\n- describe\n- identify\n- classify\n- idea\n- example\n- distinguish\n- manipulate\n- demonstrate\n- describe\n- examine\n- separate\n- criticise\n- arrange\n- show\n- extend\n- question\n- change\n- illustrate\n- compile\n- give\n- tell\n- give\n- label\n- break\n- experiment\n- summarise\n- define\n- Analyse\n- construct\n- associate\n- recognise\n- observe\n- illustrate\n- explain\n- classify\n- debate\n- relate\n- discuss\n- relate\n- make\n- know\n- draw\n- apply\n- infer\n- list\n\n# DEMONSTRATED ILLS\n\n- Deconstructing\n- Implementing\n- Exemplifying\n- Recognising\n- Comparing\n- Interpreting\n- Organising\n- Structuring\n- Comparing\n- Classifying\n- Explaining\n- Describing\n- Attributing\n- Identifying\n- Executing\n- Retrieving\n- Outlining\n- Carrying\n- Inferring\n- Recalling\n- Finding\n- Using\n- Listing\n- Naming\n\n# EXPLANATION\n\nVarious its a apply integrated, significance among situations been and understanding information in into embedded (or has remember whole. whole. relations familiar what become use of meaning learned translating recall, deeper ability appreciates knowledge and break relation in the to other identified the skills and shows grasps has situations. in the ability are and learner parts component learner knowledge the new aspects learned. restate the the the by.\n\n# LEVEL OF DESCRIPTION\n\n# COGNITIVE\n\n|   |           |   | 1             | REMEMBERING |   |\n| - | --------- | - | ------------- | ----------- | - |\n|   |           |   | UNDERSTANDING |             |   |\n|   | ANALYSING |   |               |             |   |\n\n# CAPS\n\n153\n\n\n\n---\n\nAPPENDIX 2\n# PHYSICAL SCIENCES GRADES 10-12\n\nIt is when not of scientific teaching Chemistry should be integrated.

The mass of a substance will be proportional to the reaction rate produced. Therefore, the volume of gas will decrease down.\n\n# Guidelines for Teachers\n\nAs the concentrations for the initial reaction will give a fixed value, note that baking powder slows the reaction.\n\n# Material Resource\n\nChemistry SCIENCES LEARNERS\n\nWhat an A4 page can teach a friend about the relationship between fractions.\n\n# Activities\n\nDivide your object into equal parts. For example, the collected volume of vinegar and baking powder can demonstrate the reaction of a cube.\n\n# Practical Activity\n\nTake a ruler, and divide the paper into pieces. Use the data to graph the relationship between the variables.\n\n# Content\n\nExpress the relationship between quantities using algebraic expressions. The law of gravitation is a practical example of direct proportionality.\n\n# Skills\n\nHighlight the constant k, which is the quotient of two variables. The relationship can be expressed as y = k/x.\n\n# Topics\n\nUse ratios and fractions to describe changing constants in equations.
