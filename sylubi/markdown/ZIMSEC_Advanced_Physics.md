Find arithmetic means, powers (including reciprocals and square roots), sines, cosines, tangents (and the inverse functions), exponentials and logarithms (lg and ln)\n- take account of accuracy in numerical work and handle calculations so that significant figures are neither lost unnecessarily nor justified\n- make approximate evaluations of numerical expressions (e.g. π² ≈ 10) and use such approximations to check the magnitude of calculated results.\n\n# Algebra\n\nCandidates should be able to:\n\n- change the subject of an equation. Most relevant equations involve only the simpler operations but may include positive and negative indices and square roots.\n- solve simple algebraic equations. Most relevant equations are linear but some may involve inverse and inverse square relationships. Linear simultaneous equations and the use of the formula to obtain the solutions of quadratic equations are required.\n- substitute physical quantities into physical equations using consistent units and check the dimensional consistency of such equations.\n- set up simple algebraic equations as mathematical models of physical situations, and identify inadequacies of such models.\n- recognise and use the logarithms of expressions like ab, a^b, x^n, e^(kx) and understand the use of logarithms in relation to quantities with values that range over several orders of magnitude.\n\n---\n\nPhysics Syllabus Forms 5 - 6\n\n# Geometry and trigonometry\n\nCandidates should be able to:\n\n- calculate areas of right-angled and isosceles triangles, circumference and area of circles, areas and volumes of cuboids, cylinders and spheres\n- use Pythagoras’ theorem, similarity of triangles, the angle sum of a triangle\n- use sines, cosines and tangents of angles (especially for 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°)\n- use the trigonometric relationships for triangles:\n- - Sine rule\n- Cosine rule\n\nuse sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ and cosθ ≈ 1 for small θ; sin²θ + cos²θ = 1\n- understand the relationship between degrees and radians, convert from one to the other and use the appropriate system in context.\n\n# Vectors\n\nCandidates should be able to:\n\n- find the resultant of two coplanar vectors, recognising situations where vector addition is appropriate\n- obtain expressions for components of a vector in perpendicular directions, recognising situations where vector resolution is appropriate.\n\n# Graphs\n\nCandidates should be able to:\n\n- translate information between graphical, numerical, algebraic and verbal forms\n- select appropriate variables and scales for graph plotting\n- determine the gradient, intercept and intersection of linear graphs\n- choose, by inspection, a straight line which will serve as the line of best fit through a set of data points presented graphically\n- draw a curved trend line through a set of data points presented graphically, when the arrangement of these data points is clearly indicative of a non-linear relationship\n- recall standard linear form y = mx + c and rearrange relationships into linear form where appropriate\n- sketch and recognise the forms of plots of common simple expressions like 1/x, x², 1/x², sinx, cosx, e^(-x)\n- draw a tangent to a curve, and understand and use the gradient of the tangent as a means to obtain the gradient of the curve at a point\n- understand and use the area below a curve where the area has physical significance.\n\n# Treatment of uncertainties\n\nCandidates should be able to:\n\n- convert absolute uncertainty estimates into fractional or percentage uncertainty estimates and vice versa\n- show uncertainty estimates, in absolute terms, beside every value in a table of results\n- calculate uncertainty estimates in derived quantities\n- show uncertainty estimates as error bars on a graph\n- estimate the absolute uncertainty in the gradient of a graph by recalling that absolute uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line\n- estimate the absolute uncertainty in the y-intercept of a graph by recalling that absolute uncertainty = y-intercept of line of best fit – y-intercept of worst acceptable line\n- express a quantity as a value, an uncertainty estimate and a unit.\n\n43\n\n---\n\n\n# Physics\n\nexpress a quantity as a value, an uncertainty estimate and a unit.\n\n# Syllabus Forms 5 -

6\n# (c) Glossary of Assessment command words\n\nThis glossary should prove helpful to candidates as a guide, although it is not exhaustive and it has deliberately been kept brief. Candidates should understand that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context. The number of marks allocated for any part of a question is a guide to the depth required for the answer.\n\n1. Define (the term(s) ...) is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase, such as the defining equation with symbols identified, is required.\n2. What is meant by ... normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The number of marks indicated will suggest the amount of supplementary comment required.\n3. Explain may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.\n4. State implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained ‘by inspection’.\n5. List requires a number of points with no elaboration. If a specific number of points is requested, this number should not be exceeded.\n6. Describe requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. For particular phenomena, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. The amount of description intended is suggested by the indicated mark value.\n7. Discuss requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.\n8. Deduce/Predict implies that candidates are not expected to produce the required answer by recall, but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question, or may depend on answers extracted in an earlier part of the question.\n9. Suggest is used in two main contexts. It may imply either that there is no unique answer or that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a new situation (one that may not, formally, be in the syllabus).\n10. Calculate is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown.\n11. Measure implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.\n12. Determine often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly, but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula, e.g. the Young modulus, relative molecular mass.\n13. Show is used where a candidate is expected to derive a given result. It is important that the terms being used by candidates are stated explicitly and that all stages in the derivation are stated clearly.\n14. Estimate implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned. Candidates should make any necessary simplifying assumptions about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.\n15. Sketch (applied to graph work) implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct.\n\nHowever, candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked\n\n49\n\n---\n\n# 13.\n\nShow is used where a candidate is expected to derive a given result.

However, candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. On a sketch graph it is essential that candidates clearly indicate what is being plotted on each axis.\n\n# 16.\n\nSketch (applied to diagrams) implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable, though care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.\n\n# 17.\n\nCompare requires candidates to provide both similarities and differences between things or concepts.\n\n# (D) Data and formulae\n\nThe following data and formulae will appear as pages 2 and 3 in Papers 1, 2 and 3.\n\n# DATA\n\n| speed of light in free space | c = 3.00 x 108 ms−1                               |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| permeability of free space   | μ0 = 4π x 10−7 Hm−1                               |\n| permittivity of free space   | ɛ0 = 8.85 x 10−12 Fm−1 (1/4πɛ0 = 8.99 x 109 mF−1) |\n| elementary charge            | e = 1.60 x 10−19 C                                |\n| the Planck constant          | h = 6.63 x 10−34 Js                               |\n| unified atomic mass unit     | 1 u = 1.66 x 10−27 kg                             |\n| rest mass of electron        | me = 9.11 x 10−31 kg                              |\n| rest mass of proton          | mp = 1.67 x 10−27 kg                              |\n| molar gas constant           | R = 8.31 JK−1mol−1                                |\n| the Avogadro constant        | NA = 6.02 x 1023 mol−1                            |\n| the Boltzmann constant       | k = 1.38 x 10−23 JK−1                             |\n| gravitational constant       | G = 6.67 x 10−11 Nm2kg−2                          |\n| acceleration of free fall    | g = 9.81 ms−2                                     |\n\n# FORMULAE\n\n| uniformly accelerated motion   | s = ut + ½at2             |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |\n|                                | v2 = u2 + 2as             |\n| work done on/by a gas          | W = p ∆V                  |\n| gravitational potential        | φ = – Gm/r                |\n| hydrostatic pressure           | p = ρgh                   |\n| pressure of an ideal gas       | p = 1 N2 c2               |\n| simple harmonic motion         | a = –ω2x                  |\n| velocity of particle in s.h.m. | v = v0 cos ωt             |\n|                                | v = ±ω√(x2 − x02)         |\n| Doppler effect                 | f = f0 (v ± vs)           |\n| electric potential             | V = 4πɛ0r                 |\n| capacitors in series           | 1/C = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + . . . |\n| capacitors in parallel         | C = C1 + C2 + . . .       |\n| energy of charged capacitor    | W = 1/2 QV                |\n| electric current               | I = Anvq                  |\n| resistors in series            | R = R1 + R2 + . . .       |\n| resistors in parallel          | 1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + . . . |\n| Hall voltage                   | VH = Bntq                 |\n| alternating current/voltage    | x = x0 sin ωt             |\n| radioactive decay              | x = x0 exp(−λt)           |\n| decay constant                 | λ = 0.693/t1/2            |\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Physics Syllabus Forms 5 - 6\n\n# Formulas\n\nthe Boltzmann constant\nk = 1.38 x 10−23 JK−1\n\ngravitational constant\nG = 6.67 x 10−11 Nm2kg−2\n\nacceleration of free fall\ng = 9.81 ms−2\n\n# Uniformly Accelerated Motion\n\ns = ut + ½at2\n\nv2 = u2 + 2as\n\n# Work Done on/By a Gas\n\nW = p ∆V\n\n# Gravitational Potential\n\n∅ = – Gm/r\n\n# Hydrostatic Pressure\n\np = ρgh\n\n# Pressure of an Ideal Gas\n\np = 1/3 N V\n\n# Simple Harmonic Motion\n\na = –ω2x\n\nVelocity of Particle in S.H.M.\nv = v0 cos(ωt)\n\nv = ±ω√(x2 − x02)\n\n# Doppler Effect\n\nf = f0 (v ± vs)\n\n# Electric Potential\n\nV = 4πɛ0r\n\n# Capacitors in Series\n\n1/C = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + ...\n\n# Capacitors in Parallel\n\nC = C1 + C2 + ...\n\n# Energy of Charged Capacitor\n\nW = 1/2 QV\n\n# Electric Current\n\nI = Anvq\n\n# Resistors in Series\n\nR = R1 + R2 + ...\n\n# Resistors in Parallel\n\n1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ...\n\n# Hall Voltage\n\nVH = Bntq\n\n# Alternating Current/Voltage\n\nx = x0 sin(ωt)\n\n# Radioactive Decay\n\nx = x0 exp(-λt)\n\n# Decay Constant\n\nλ = 0.693/t1/2\n\n# Commonly Used Materials And Apparatus\n\nThe list is not exhaustive: other items are usually required, to allow for variety in the questions set.\n\n- Cells: 1.5 V\n- Connecting leads and crocodile clips\n- Digital ammeter, minimum ranges 0–1 A reading to 0.01 A or better, 0–200 mA reading to 0.1 mA or better, 0–20 mA reading to 0.01 mA or better (digital multimeters are suitable)\n- Digital voltmeter, minimum ranges 0–2 V reading to 0.001 V or better, 0–20 V reading to 0.01 V or better (digital multimeters are suitable)\n- Lamp and holder: 6 V 60 mA; 2.5 V 0.3 A\n- Power supply: variable up to 12 V d.c.
